Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people should meet today .
a chapel that is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former basis of farmers .
the oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone who had to get upset because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online charts .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that one cannot recognize as such .
the large overview map shows more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called judgement sheets .
according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying management , these were developed between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally removed the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Munich judgment sheet dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the comparison of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Early / Today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the most impressive example of the provincial capital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , thus 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings houses focus around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ts from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original recording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no farmers left there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the judgment sheet , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße there were once people locked with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based group Ir@@ ren Institution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced in his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
there was space for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
youth in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet at the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
to the west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected in an architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original works of the Ir@@ ren Institution which was destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once situated at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second subur@@ ban railway line .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents can occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; it says in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim to give minority rights , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted incidents such as racial discrimination against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recently published report by the office of the General Prosecutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , showing that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring with money or to let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I report , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration infrin@@ gements , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of the Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the ground .
at the cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ place association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and likewise many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ sten comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit from such steep surfaces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area provides a lot of work , a lot of things have to be worked with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and cultivated this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he did not conduct bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for their support
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the open @-@ air area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was promoted through Leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss was also firmly established : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape route line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will allow for the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art subsi@@ dy subsi@@ dence .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a conveyor chain designated by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the fenced area may not be tra@@ dable ( reluc@@ t@@ ance over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ ste fence project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ s Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took on its importance , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is exper@@ tly correct , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the vibr@@ atory words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your f@@ aint , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the afflicted garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parent waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they completed a very political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical ima@@ gery .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not meant to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever like to acknowledge .
her torch is not meant to illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle recalls a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world champion@@ ships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special has been developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected a team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made whole of course were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ Silver medal winner , who will compete in the fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ range runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season that included victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to platforms .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a World Championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block the critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the elec@@ ting of voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he bl@@ us@@ hed with criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ file his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called official and of employees paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not a troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials and to arrest or arrest prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers put on his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project online papers .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and discourse belongs to the basis of our nation .
and true guidance is to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for local comfort over the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he stuck this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending master@@ y for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had gained it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who , after his 50@@ th birthday , came to the European Senior Tour this year , returns to the promotion on homeland .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how far it has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , there are 16@@ 7 cases of lung cancer per year due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases were given in Germany due to liabilities per year .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze , head of the construction site .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as a lot of mountains hide in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a big problem for the building of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off filters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relates Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she uses no stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the sal@@ ted bul@@ b is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public H@@ ander@@ ing in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ ring up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desolate . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs that were transformed into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skir@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had only leaves at our bodies in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
the demands of the Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 of Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s have been genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are E@@ ating Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful execution and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ o , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers grab@@ bed their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who d@@ rank , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ chant im@@ i@@ ti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe before .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ aking still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans had only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson of the State Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto had a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a protest mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody re@@ dependence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress whatsoever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that he is still in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the army searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ ario Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly arrived , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to account for the officers involved and to withdraw the police Brig@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ lem@@ aker for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to work in four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier immigrants .
they rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , despite their rare permission for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - set up the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him : &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also wishes to participate in the session , but want to remain anonymous .
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but the ones of Papua promise that they will probably not be voted for Jok@@ ho@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the attacks of the Pan@@ i@@ ai , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the board of directors .
he wants Jok@@ ho@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least let them not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fires capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that has been swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one inci@@ dentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and when people cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an occup@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from facing , exterior pan@@ elling for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles was only to be played on two winning points , very thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics remain so preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the complete package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the application .
even before the vote , after a lot of contradictions , the proposal was already suggested to finish the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 is only comparatively small details : in the next year , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the right to host the year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in training places , etc . and the players will have to complete less formal media meetings prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings forbidden objects into the airplane , finds a survey out
a survey of flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the plane while acci@@ dentally caused forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had been bel@@ ated that they had gone wrong with guns , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travelers were more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items intentionally passing by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly worn objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought pro@@ hibit@@ ing drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many mistakenly sent smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were the ones who most often fly .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while the people thought the T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zz@@ ling number when announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancell@@ ations made with the new mass market model 3 .
during the past months , Mus@@ k has frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now Mus@@ k dre@@ amed : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3.000 had already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models have to be put together - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , the in@@ compatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the down@@ turn of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint , which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it &apos;s about a time limit on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the meeting for one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly committed to blocking or del@@ aying regulation to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sting of regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ zin proposed that his turn at O@@ zone standards was very easy to strengthen the willingness of the EP@@ O to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings and we take fri@@ ght seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA states that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft law approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was not made for the Senate in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smoke that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this fall California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone evol@@ ves when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for start@@ ling course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental poll@@ s and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the Six@@ th Charity seren@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ custom@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ bey &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wor@@ ding of the document , in addition to the former parish church , was also a splendid courtyard to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was one and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as emerges from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps , dating back to 1600 , confirm this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval village law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Val Gar@@ dena of the two dates to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half fell .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ building still existing today remained a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Rent@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as success@@ ors by Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers we invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann talks about the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
a trunk in front of the cemetery takes place at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; organis@@ er the fantastic views .
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to homeland care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini rein@@ forces .
association wants to test approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim remains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the land council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is resist@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on land rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are meant to prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ fter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan - but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mal@@ function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted lic@@ ences are still un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines according to plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle indicates the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it as an occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of content on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , electricity consumption of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW I wants to invest some 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in Lin@@ ni@@ ch &apos;s wind park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashes : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ bach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more persons were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; city and retailer plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ weekend &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping expedition into the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise the customers for this , which offers their own city off the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with sal@@ es@@ so@@ ff@@ ing Sunday , talks with all business owners and hosts to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , potential customers are to be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread , had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , Germany , announced that five Thurin@@ gian cities will take part in the nation @-@ wide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appreciation of local commerce and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchase behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .

Tru@@ mp replaced the tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to called on to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president appe@@ aled to him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to make Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; land@@ fill &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ors Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the mo@@ b &apos;s leader - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and glan@@ cing through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a succession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , Ci@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge has been coming back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ sailed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the creation of post@@ ures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the state Georgia and a life @-@ time citizen .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays down a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia made it the first time to give her voice to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black color @-@ guard Roger Mal@@ com set a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby that she wore was not her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b embra@@ ced the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepares and ordered the kill@@ ings , concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and ret@@ ou@@ ching the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual adjustment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - entered a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ ters Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es up the h@@ ester and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t believe white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is precisely where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a trauma is above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pe sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you are standing on the same country where Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sitting at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ g@@ ged Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ mus@@ sen hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience together with the actors is sitting together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the night@@ fall with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance has left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his desk , he e@@ ats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ uring is inspiring in a sense as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine k@@ ills pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power , and gre@@ ed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; staging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhein@@ gold - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they kidn@@ ap Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ley , drag a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk and give the ri@@ ot @-@ cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous nasty Hagen , that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ingly , who hum@@ bly bow down to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat in casual casual wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of the whist@@ le concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of their view .
I draw a positive resume .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in a stone belt at the furniture fair , once a week I am helping in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , i.e. a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I made Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineering course , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realised for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on location , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you can be your FS@@ J .
it can be done from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care .
for me it was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see and see my own strengths as it really runs out .
unlike civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young man , who has been brought out of the family - you always have to go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is .
Pear@@ son brings more 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job cuts , General Director John Fall@@ on , predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after a growth of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ y @-@ Attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , informed a NATO declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; carried by people . &quot;
the statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a big concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide high@@ land killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is weighing up , raising the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ref@@ usal to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ oth Rule by S@@ lay around
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the government of Obama , according to which states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done one day after 15 states accused the Agency because of the step of step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions have to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and increasing respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ es decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing part of the property was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take until the area has been part of the church community so far , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council still ho@@ vers , such a common room is not to be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of the sen@@ iors @-@ friendly living , but openly in the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the current budget has already been decided by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says T@@ j@@ aden , capable of handling 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a stick between the legs , stating that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , it &apos;s not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , that &apos;s the addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it is not as simple as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with which one does not move so well , but now you sit in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing it hard with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind a subsi@@ dy subsi@@ dy of wealthy or non @-@ foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , one does not give a grant , but gets a real equivalent , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s proposal to appro@@ ve the proposed resolution is found in three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ eth on Wednesday and badly injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the cycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg in direction Hil@@ den on the cycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove up the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the correspondence .
he met with a car that led a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ouch .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals lack the defending champion in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , staff members at German Soccer record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also give up to David Al@@ aba in Du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory field of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the duo of the German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game was sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Soccer League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
hike in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the plan of the society Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meet the information needs of many resin visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inquiry che@@ eses St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be complemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection selection .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star@@ board will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star brigh@@ ter than another , although it could be far removed .
it will also be taught in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to be seen .
since 2014 the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ ship - the planet path at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen .
beginning in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail with its stel@@ es leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commune of tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to down@@ gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and standard of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measuring exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the plug with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council Light weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organization Super spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia picked out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on lightweight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes need this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko had to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who are also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight title combat in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he could possibly participate in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous compli@@ ment to Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side looks &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stro@@ kes , then boxes .
both said that they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ ses to Tire Plat@@ zer
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connecting point Market .
the car pulled to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ turned and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the second : 2 at the season op@@ ener of Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defense formation in Au@@ e points brings points .
with the first season game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , wouldn &apos;t the two opponents have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we need to better fit in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain is to be optimised further .
and the for@@ ts don &apos;t want to catch a gate after a breach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so that no longer exists alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make as many play@@ able mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim was forced to break pre@@ mat@@ urely for a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know 100 % where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland come as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience its players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum seek@@ ers &quot; review published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the age of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , migration has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , during X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say , we shouldn &apos;t do as though we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the department of road and transport in the government of the government of Fri@@ bourg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a side fixing that is also used as an operating track .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian lane should be gone .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger @-@ t@@ act @-@ feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs about the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished initially .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ strasse and the Flat@@ her@@ on towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the C@@ ret@@ an Vol@@ cano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad coalition that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites for the loud poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top pair for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D people , but rather demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; Every@@ one at a table &quot; was originally planned on the well place , but is now taking place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elle - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to take care of such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a refusal because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ me there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does it : at 8@@ pm , there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , in the Stadthalle , several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair@@ person Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now , the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is said shortly after 9 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
for example , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is a soloist with the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo trump@@ eter of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how Johann Sebastian Bach achieves Bach &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games combine to a fascinating overall art work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart has openly talked about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hollywood star &apos;s best @-@ known relationship was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who eventually disper@@ sed bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ esses the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I had been . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , she suffered under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to settle in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won the West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about € 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party by Gover@@ nor Justice is a further blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is but the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut off with competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF committee voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found references to state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia has accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still free , he said re@@ porters in London after a speech at IA@@ AF Council .
act of mour@@ ning for Mali crashed soldiers
at a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in Mali with a helicopter crash .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
for yet un@@ explained fall arrest , Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ nerst@@ ones of their field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took their leave .
after that the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ eker .
the bun@@ ches laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense von der Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rod @-@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the air@@ crafts of the fighter @-@ helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show von der Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this gave the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal pair is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue her communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to be King .
in 2016 , he retired and also dis@@ covers the title of &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife always flo@@ cked the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of reign in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival all I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were equal to two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because the resolution of the parliament was on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens from their parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official Sunday election date , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ester founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her election circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U President Björn T@@ atz@@ ler wants his group to welcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the agricultural day as quickly as possible resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the State Parliament el@@ ects the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be legally controlled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ek@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ously audi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ru@@ ster called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called upon the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course assuming that she has received her Land@@ tag mandate , which she has received from the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deliberately chose not to engage in the faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of El@@ ke T@@ ester from Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Social Democrats Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the Australian exit costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her latest vanity and fru@@ stration of her personal interests before the welfare of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD general secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony takes this dirty business and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Björn T@@ üm@@ me wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ester in the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force at that time before the SPD , but SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against gyp@@ sy , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ essi@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the situation of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless .
if the return maximum content of 0.00@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct guilt .
rather , due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they have to expect economic damage .
as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in serious cases .
is there any lack of personal or conclu@@ sive responsibility ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ ting really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only obtain safe and traffic @-@ ready foods .
if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pan@@ eled means are manufacturers , traders and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ repell@@ ent animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how F@@ oot Ball &apos;s Financial Rules affect N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules established in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was funded without big losses .
Barcelona has paid € 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to extract Brazil from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar will sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruler family of Qatar .
clubs may turn out a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources , which enable them to reach the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had made enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and cra@@ cked to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P acquisition period running until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini dropped from the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G pays the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption payments for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to b@@ ypass their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ fish company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate in@@ comes .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority has been infl@@ ated .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Q@@ at@@ ari via payments from the Organisation Com@@ mittees of the World Cup 2022 .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have been denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be an ambassador and that such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could easily be found out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G imply that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke below the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey purchases .
the association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s march by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Lup@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different paths or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years , chocolate has made Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation stands in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current vendor Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white boards packed with red @-@ white boards spread over 14 grams per year before landing on the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ der insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants are there with the new tender , the Swiss won &apos;t want to reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a comment .
chocolate panels are distributing the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
prior to closing a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced a partnership with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y to place the logo .
the airline works together with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the customers of First Class will be spoiled with delicacies from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in the Business Class nasty passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class , is also distributed on the short circuit .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pre @-@ think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a promising variety of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by stepping on the core of the day - middle @-@ aged actors playing hor@@ ny children who grow up - they managed to regain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who now play adults , is less emotional and his par@@ ody is more based on the principle of watering , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which cri@@ es the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character brow@@ ses through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot , involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s man@@ sta@@ che from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that this fran@@ chise might spell as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West E@@ Q@@ AS icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ vo@@ iced Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask - that it is often the only one .
with six long episodes , it is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; who was re@@ arranged to a lesser length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always visiting the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for a promise .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in beating the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz died on Friday .
in this context , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the police ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , as well as rape and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the const@@ ancy of organised drug traffi@@ cking in the south @-@ German region .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
for this reason , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in view of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ ppi , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the Ban@@ de bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign registry in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreigners &apos; register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may result in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data had not been adequately maintained , the quality of the data has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long since become alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of sufficient people there are also EU citizens who wouldn &apos;t have to travel abroad at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false arrangements , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore means in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to return refugee families to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Daily Newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads to such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees who reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with poor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening for the lack of shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best score achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
first of all , Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multi@@ lateral willingness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the municipal council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors that make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the district administrator of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , three persons could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions that were carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second @-@ best result of 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Kreis@@ rund@@ gang manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members in this month to increase , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that interest rates would be needed over the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation pre@@ heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut economic package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks starting next February , although it has been said that it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the realities of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts , adjusted down@@ wards for this and the next year , are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in comparison to the forecast expected in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have mut@@ ed the rising expectations to a rate increase and GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is likely to recover slightly after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , since tigh@@ tening will be even worse before improving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote caused by the sin@@ king of the ground .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and will put it on in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the transgres@@ sion in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ine , director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the recent decline in swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages take out , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug worth 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS since September .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered from the health service to a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling of the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces HIV transmission to infection @-@ prone significantly .
pre@@ p prior to taking intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who are eligible for treatment , gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners , who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants identify who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive purchasing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used on a large scale targeted , recorded and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p if it is targeted at people in need and vulnerable people , it is possible to change the English epide@@ mic .
from September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to step closer to the end of HIV infection in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former Bank@@ erin with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something similar to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this apartment was shown to me in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add a storage room and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to keep it working .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units room for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have managed to increase the floor space while at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which can help create an emotional bond in your home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall in the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate in Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and designer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers purchased 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - has about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of difficulty for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick during the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept himself very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by text message to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new chief of staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico tells us that the White House &apos;s new head of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new head of staff of the White House , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wanted to fix : bad information coming into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be convinced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February with polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral officials , to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have contained no more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his employees managed it several times to keep anger away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented it from being prov@@ oked by Tru@@ mp Kontro@@ ver@@ sen .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - occupied entirely with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply the president with du@@ bi@@ ous information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp is able to react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of sh@@ kan@@ es or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .

&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the base of war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their stat@@ ely homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought together horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ej@@ ected only in May , but without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council , in order to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ imped@@ ed in order to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after being forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull , Soli@@ hull , said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible notify anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also recei@@ pts from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatic rise in numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a gathering place , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not without controversy in the council at that time .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt estate .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof you have already been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest Style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated inner city level , Sch@@ erer under@@ lines .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up widely , explains Sch@@ erer more .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define himself exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
also the outer complexes are brought to the fore @-@ man , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : US Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the body has recorded the work over the past weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people entrusted to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already initial inv@@ itations to the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also took more and more tru@@ mp private and business environment under the microscope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tru@@ mp personally moved into the centre and looked for the reproach that the President might hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether it should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called anchor clips .
most of the time , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite persons for the hearing under E@@ id .
according to CN@@ N , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were asked to testify , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the constitution of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but these work usually in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be as@@ cer@@ tained against the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed in this way , it was explained in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ra@@ ging , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey told a Senate Committee in June , Tru@@ mp asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later former President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired upon the president of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators set out legislative plans on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the western Ant@@ ar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the scar@@ c@@ ely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Shel@@ f .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice towers that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
all in all , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
in the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed a few years ago .
a complete mis@@ chief might be dis@@ integrated there , writes A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as at present .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece break at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest shelf @-@ file of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica after A@@ WI @-@ data with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly merge , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers are not able to bring back the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , in recent decades many glaci@@ ers of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long skir@@ t of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Survey , the polar surface of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med around three degrees over the last 50 years and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to have Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &quot; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration war@@ med up .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be held this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the parties &quot; wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for professionals , but to counter@@ act the application shortage future @-@ oriented , it says .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and out@@ war@@ dly , to show concrete measures for clim@@ bers and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service for disease or age related reasons .
high time to act , so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he was already in the Krei@@ sau day for a fist @-@ thick surprise when he openly questioned the personnel cost cover and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which enable an exit from the communal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money is available only if one changes to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which employees care about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that deploy lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign up a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to speak to the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes tu@@ g@@ boat migrants , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors bear fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun seeing light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants entering these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , of which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many metres of altitude have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neustadt has been controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and nearly 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had got to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgrades itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y by wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages .
these have also recognized the first German ca@@ ver@@ ns who are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be present online much more often on these markets than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA at competitive level are challenged .
as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bel has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the itte &apos;s player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bel also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study conducted by the Del@@ o@@ itte Company and the Federation of Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth on e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to exceed 130 million .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
e @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ bel .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into no@@ stal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t cling to that only in football everything stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter for the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts has been condemned to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she completely depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day at which I am not bl@@ ending the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person with whom I had been together every day since I was born , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is switch off the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter pays attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut over a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not har@@ med .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made a divided bond to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain .
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the sign of the coach Kim@@ i as well .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the professional C @-@ El@@ f existing from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of holiday .
sugar is distributed to those who enjoy a lot , which you want to keep in your mood .
so those who were chosen to approach the heritage of Lah@@ m can use a little extra motivation only well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old became a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ i took part in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
V@@ idal therefore decided to re@@ play his missing fitness ( folded not ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus decided to tie in to the accompli@@ sh@@ ments of the Asia @-@ trip ( fold also condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not have a negative impact on their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot .
that after all worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the rep@@ utable Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , moreover , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game @-@ building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bayern @-@ Welt is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game afterwards .
for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs Rud@@ y did not give one or two , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ Inqu@@ iry of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minist@@ erial staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledge attacks the desires of the economy , which have all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 the construction law is to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Plan .
the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Ministeri@@ al spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier seeks , as suggested by Wis@@ cons@@ in , in the wine an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports of German exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sig has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 Euro is envis@@ aged for the passed master exam and 2500 euros , if graduates go independently within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is to quickly create facts , at the same time fail to make the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Industry of Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to hire the bis@@ sing at the Landes@@ betrieb Mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied .
the Chamber demands more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country will invest more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country , as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated power supplies in an I@@ HK survey with grade 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left L@@ vi@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she already cleared the field for discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer the software to update in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as travel restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising diesel @-@ powered exhaust gases also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ow@@ ning the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes that could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indic@@ ted in the United States , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , on the mor@@ row Saturday a raft breaks through Munich , which has a special message .
if it goes on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Spe@@ ech wants to clear up .
on the raft one sees a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a protective game of ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los grow@@ n@@ oses and laughter against the pain
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the rab@@ bits of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and works on a film .
his message : laughter because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he suggested himself as a drawer for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist was always inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits at the drawing table , works every day for almost ten hours .
through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on cartoon animation and TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any animal in his drawings - which has a jack @-@ in @-@ one as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he is more focused on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is wor@@ dless produced .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence in danger of climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions remin@@ ding of dro@@ ught and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the farm research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on la@@ ven@@ der lifetime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ goats , and in very dry weather there are so many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a land@@ sk@@ ate camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days .
the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a black@@ board at the front of the room : enemies , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate in the whole country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is their publisher and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process journalists cases , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely put in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ete and even though the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks until his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve rivers . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is virtually nothing but silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , de@@ gu@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to news@@ stands .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to practice journ@@ alism without hitting the drugs poison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard fitting experiments without fear of cens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ I award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task you inv@@ ade as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best carry out their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anno@@ y@@ ance is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero , and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activ@@ ist in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the governor himself called not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spent three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the former famous box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending concentrated on the governor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this local area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military assault .
just a few months earlier , readers considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few notes and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
since then she has asked her to be re @-@ r@@ ins@@ ed by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , involved government officials and an equally valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ guard group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials over the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .

&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to sum up .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
among the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her for reporting on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even realize that their fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best @-@ preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) ground cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rier . &quot;
researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white clo@@ aking to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to better interfere with its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say what it suggests that it has been threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with care .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ age is common , the results are surprising since the size of the Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ ving animals survi@@ ving .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals who use the counter sh@@ ad@@ owing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank down to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative fl@@ ak@@ y skin but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just send a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is in sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , who lived ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank into the sea after death and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the sub@@ du@@ ed arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average around 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swe@@ pt through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater rep@@ ay@@ ment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the skin st@@ alli@@ ons are still covered with b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a lot@@ tery prize .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it will .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , between the junction offices of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another during a thunder@@ storm .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wide range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the city of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long Rück@@ st@@ au was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : no clu@@ e is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or tear@@ ing the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the online ticket inspection .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train card de@@ valuation without creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
it also has to be purchased through the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation is then issued to the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant is at No. Y at ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ d@@ ants ch@@ ats in the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB remote marketing executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest draw@@ backs .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need for validation of online tickets .
either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document that you have to assign .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the bott@@ oms or big space and delays in controlling their own tickets and at the end the Schaff@@ ner takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that only at the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other conc@@ essions on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core .
only one day after arriving in New York City , the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ou@@ ted on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of twe@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of a lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she switched off her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , guaranteed another police officer and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ illed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from age 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of people &apos;s view , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they discussed a conversation that they had seen countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on right now , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black condition and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter had joined together with a local business@@ man who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l came to a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Tor@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct insi@@ der .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for this is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show unexpected personal aspects of Ferr@@ el &apos;s life as she falls in love with and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ el &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as a heart of the film based on her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person that stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these junc@@ tions as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras have long disappeared in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the Bit Gallery moves the people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the subject hardly leaves one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build on the fact that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the other businesses profit , the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
it will end with the start of construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Bed@@ a Square with the possibility of sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies always liked very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing direc@@ ts in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why shopping in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find that unnecessary .
there are already enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special business is almost no longer and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit @-@ Galerie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already manage to distribute all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the incredibly many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not place any place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former intelligence analy@@ st committed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly announced diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and landmark sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit intellectual comment , not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but openly talked about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ceful , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits un@@ well on a driver seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ to@@ cks and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use became un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which in the course of two years were ex@@ changing several letters .
they even created a cartoon &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform the Over@@ seas &apos;s judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama indeed had only a few days after the book was released to demand man &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similarly , at least in a biological way , we all are .
&quot; what people hope to take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she shows up with a hands @-@ free phone in the hand of the disciplinary erns of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they speak your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
a nationwide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who will be sought after after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court of Appe@@ al show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several tor@@ ches .
a Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them is now being assessed and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ elles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker at the University and of Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to face .
chief Communications Officer at Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ dies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motifs , including a possible home incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that outlines the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ USA@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has conf@@ essed a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales force r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has preferred to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the WA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ USA@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the moment
these were distributed by the company groups .

from now on , only eggs are to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lice @-@ ice .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called for help from outside .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the look@@ out to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to offer specialist groups and demographic groups , to employ employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years won with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval results - so you can re@@ bo@@ unce why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance @-@ Industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 , following the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent allows companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly , like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope to be a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to support Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter won $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more strongly committed to making this business successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and employees to demo@@ tiv@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4.000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow your colleagues ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really listened to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t worry about why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the Summer Courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center in the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real pedal for the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ges moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood have carried out practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 , they are expected to hold 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it out , they plac@@ ated further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice once the camp is finished , which is not an easy task , given the clear lines of its fields , from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ h@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been thrown with foot@@ balls , which is a protective enclosure behind a door@@ pole , which will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ in players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third parties and display their results under the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks , if they fail to promptly eradi@@ cate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts @-@ review was started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to be testing its feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger days , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his hom@@ ely seat in the Hav@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ert@@ wicz , Bri@@ t May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book written by Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emo@@ tionally .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; alas , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have rated my welcome greeting a bit &apos; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape guards , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to care about the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats &quot; said &quot; Oh , throw it down on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who what possessed : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising broke out in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er@@ ship , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is portra@@ yed who directed his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
the Dar@@ w@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen appeared to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men er@@ ase their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote Er@@ in . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ seh@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ op@@ ing of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad Honne@@ fer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises in Ankara on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the pres@@ idency of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
these were the civilians in Y@@ AS in the number of survivors .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed .
since the coup , head of State Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erd@@ og@@ an as the wi@@ re@@ aker of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the crash test as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; clean up the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an actually has the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the General Staff , there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ fests itself in the abolition of the cover ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale building in the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 7@@ 3@@ 95 officers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times she fired upon her role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an drove systematically an Islam@@ isation of the Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer sought for asylum from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , in the alliance according to the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he pre@@ tends to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by ways of changing the way citizens will be spent out of other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race ticket
over the past few months over and over the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
even before the end of the year , it is scheduled to be built on the ailing track on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction works will begin on the track in accordance with the Federal Ministry of Transport this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Klaus atories on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he paid the costs for the restoration of the route to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract on which the Shuttle is to be ordered from the country also in the future will be finally agreed , declared atonement .
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said atonement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this should be ordered by the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection popular especially for tourists between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation in recent months , it has been tested as to whether the track is used by sufficient number of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ atri@@ sts have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; customize &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would allow a step@@ ford woman to look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ atri@@ sts have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female qualities , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one walks a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ led one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy for@@ gets with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to a somewhat dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their increasing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the fr@@ inge zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is however a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened world @-@ wide in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Hand@@ maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the me@@ ander@@ ing body and the cast eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not really women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp choosing relatives .
we all ost@@ ensi@@ bly strict all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
less noted is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everybody knows whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a wider context that this also involves considerable risks .
the left has been strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cru@@ el@@ ly possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be thrown off .
however , there is an even more complicated long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alize , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself falling apart from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally safe only to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ el of the New York Parks , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the central park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same plus the option to settle the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only results in a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I was tired of having my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
on the eve of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , throwing them down several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that she was lod@@ ged at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger Schools , the four @-@ door @-@ chi@@ ppers were fired from sho@@ ot@@ ers and prun@@ ing ho@@ ops to the holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to college in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes headed by S@@ ophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der had a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this the cheerful flock brought a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle at the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it brood from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken leg , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore Cy@@ lin@@ ders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten may be different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but also belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each of the four @-@ door mo@@ ths that he feels accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to classroom instruction , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over , class teacher S@@ ophi@@ a Schumacher declared .
after two years of lessons , she gave her students only very reluc@@ t@@ ance , because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door mo@@ ths . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end , all students had a song of summer time and vacation time .
there was great joy in the children .

two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal camp people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates were only valid for the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit arranged the power @-@ driving federal office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but do not yet have an exact date .
Daimler has informed us to write to every affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the changes take place ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the slopes depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive falling price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will fear that .
but just in the regions where driving robots are threatening .
in rural areas , there is no loss of value for older diesel so far .
the ACE advises , with a sale yet to wait .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) also belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with the progressive TV series already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - to depri@@ ve them of even the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ised that she will use Tru@@ mp to make her sights clear .
the Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ k City Engineer , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the position has already been written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker has been a city building master .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .
this should be enough time for a revision under consideration of the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as an under construction law authority , the applicant must present relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
would it no longer fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and itself , &quot; says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the chi@@ pper with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city viable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the low @-@ furnace car park are about to be found .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still subject to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city building master there is ample room for manoeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ la@@ che &apos;s own building yard and gardening , many things can be flexibly responded to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often men@@ ded by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye on what to do &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ cher carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( high @-@ construction ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for the past 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wishes that his successor will stay for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from Has@@ lach , who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker , should have completed a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with speci@@ alisation in architecture and have good skills in the areas of building and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are under construction and civil engineering , building guidelines , under@@ mining activities , administration of urban properties , municipal yard with building yard and urban gardening , as well as underground building rights authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines cast : south @-@ rail track closed
according to police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway tracks in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the cables .
these were so badly damaged that the incoming freight had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night @-@ hours .
close to the crime scene there were witnessed by witnesses , a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ pen@@ ar coup , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator and the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the road traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail car traffic , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum can be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be brought without disabilities .
nearly ten passenger trains had fallen on Friday morning , two of them considered long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains were not cancelled , but they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study confirms exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers usually get advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of ign@@ iting inflamm@@ ations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues .
when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance encourages immune cells in mice carrying a particular bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to tolerate more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lieu when the same system works with humans .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan analysed a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which had been kept separate , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om@@ bs of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them failed in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ anc@@ illary cells as mice , and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday night had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the bracket role played as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
but M@@ atic was exp@@ elled from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho desired three more new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements .
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the Boeing Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State U.S. , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such an advertisement before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the Party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing horror have observed the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were failures .
and one after the other .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not reliably go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the S &amp; D Group president Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis .
five months before the election of the parliament , his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its vote majority against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal executive Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxon Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ester to give back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
El@@ ke T@@ ester must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD suff@@ rage si@@ gh@@ ed when the new hi@@ de@@ message was reached on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD &apos;s prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the green parliam@@ ent@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat in the Sa@@ ar election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades at that time .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was the case - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf bank@@ rupt@@ cy cleared the party smoothly .
in the weeks after@@ ward , comrades , the comrades went over again .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived .
and with him came the next grav@@ eyard .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD president , lost his Nim@@ bus on the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because in the crisis communication , he did everything wrong after that , which can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz are fighting for political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already critic@@ ised for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey data were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant , as they promised themselves of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades , the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks shut .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , to the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ester .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic how woman T@@ ester presents her own care@@ ers over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ Mid@@ west is not elected as a direct candidate , but by the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxony deputy continues .
the logical consequence would be to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters of voters four years ago were clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as a top candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to elu@@ ci@@ date the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
grants for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
moreover , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what was happening .
since 1991 it has been in a sensation of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is important to promote interior development , not only to open up new building areas .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe gave the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the sum total amounted to € 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the church &apos;s senses .
how does a refur@@ bish@@ ment area come into being ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area there is any interest to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then also shift again .
the foot@@ bridges were on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme in which the renovation would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , i.e. per plot .
the restructuring area would then finally be set as a set of rules .
the grant period for funding has been running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock survey would be carried out only once , in the context of which those involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the statute of the statute shall take place as soon as possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each Commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about evaluating and determining when rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
a remedi@@ al note is also recorded in the land register for the respective land .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again to sensi@@ bility and get an image of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property B@@ ow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , the structural state and the reconstruction views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing District &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when operating in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that Got@@ h pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - whoever comes first , first grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to get a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country to be equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the wh@@ ites of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ cons@@ in fire@@ man car and a fork lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his supervis@@ or , the deputy Navy commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground on the plane during the time .
the recordings provided by TI@@ ME did not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal employees to use state ownership for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could harm the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; said the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
President is obliged to use them for the trip .
but to demand its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation , when the presidential jet got in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to dep@@ ose US President in the White House with precise timet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise tours in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training requirements for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter at the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax@@ pay@@ ers &apos; expense on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss against tri@@ cky task
the championship leader of the Second Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the championship third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss appears tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the championship third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League team got the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North ensure above all .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to action in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella Club , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , who is playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec , is currently playing for his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ sealed Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should be present in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgi@@ ans Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on Sunday against the Club an der Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America of O@@ MV can harm
Donald Tru@@ mp was really happy not when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the native O@@ MV , which jointly with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Sou@@ thwest North Stream 2 , are uns@@ ett@@ led .
the dru@@ m@@ set is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp even would have to impose the sanctions on an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could rep@@ el and what could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the Hit@@ ch@@ series from Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 &quot; only with more state bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ a ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .

the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role revers@@ als : the city has 46 kitchen hel@@ pers
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch itself again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
on September 1 the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iled continues to be out of house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
last year there were 2,@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are eating at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the supplied dishes , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , clean the food , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ tro@@ op units - decides on the hour &apos;s circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the c@@ ital@@ isation to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the Kü@@ ch@@ enk@@ raft to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen output - has also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical solution for the city , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble when women fully participate and be included in all parts of the choice process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 will have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 year old girl .
according to the police information , the men talked about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
then one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but this was ab@@ used .
without a prey , the duo fled .
the two young men could be arrested later by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in Glasgow , with managers from the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; first to know &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns to say that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the labor forces focus strongly on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan area Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Fili@@ al@@ cross at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and union officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ oll@@ cross &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La League may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not fail in its pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar after submitting an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did Barcelona warn Barcelona three years before the world record incident ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans level insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter over@@ turned and damaged
in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders deliberately kno@@ cked off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld Street in front of the estate number 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle had damage to over 200 euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints .
the police witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW @-@ Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the console .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW at 7.@@ 55 am on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming in direction Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car met him in his lane , so he had to so@@ ak to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ted the console .
at the passenger car was caused to damage .
the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident at all .
the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reli@@ eves the relief of Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves the relief of Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Vatican magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be measured when reporting violence among the Cathedral cats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already a part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is also said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a dev@@ out feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches have been a normal ped@@ ago@@ gical remedy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abuse cases , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the prosec@@ utor Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims of transgres@@ sions between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment of the students could also be more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims often appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence on protective prisoners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more handy when a domain record brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 page report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it at all .
he has just had eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspici@@ on of complic@@ ity or co @-@ birth in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of his sphere of influence .
it is necessary to reproach him at best , to experience it too late or to have taken first indications not serious enough .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also ex@@ poses an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who kept the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and was &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which even led to erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also distributed earrings and over@@ ly nau@@ gh@@ ty boys on the hair or ears , he even admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ olog@@ ised for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each one of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ els .
one asks oneself if it is not more to do with his fame and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
many who have never understood him are still eag@@ erly working on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the context of the report , there was a great deal about the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also include any involvement or co @-@ knowledge regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar with the domain master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is however that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a certain sense .
how do the scratch @-@ cats R@@ atz@@ inger evaluate the role of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ bes have opened themselves more urgent or more clear or even more open than against their parents , dormit@@ ories , trust teachers etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from all fr@@ at@@ ernity .
thus he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ visor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , clean : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Cathedral @-@ cats .
all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were down@@ gra@@ ded and portra@@ yed and were app@@ alling , took place all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that was , as most of the witnesses stressed , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different at the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline there , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have been st@@ owed away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states in the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently win the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school further punishment is still practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows still .
it was difficult for him to estimate that those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the testing penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fall@@ acies of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ r@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then ordinary .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. , ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ings and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger as in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject matter test also speak to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells us from his perspective , that the dom@@ ed cats only played a secondary role .
nevertheless I do not conc@@ eal that he led a stric@@ test regi@@ ment there .
but this must also be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true culture ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not even make a big singer and before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks on her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced wonderful , humor@@ ous , gra@@ cious , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something even a fly .
I receive regular contact with him , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to whom they still look up and whom they are almost worshipped .
and please , once again clearly : all that you submit to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is highly unfair , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
