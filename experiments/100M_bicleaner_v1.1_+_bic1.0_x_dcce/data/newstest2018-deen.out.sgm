<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone who had to get upset because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online charts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a flickering carpet that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large overview map shows more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called judgement sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying management, these were developed between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally removed the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Munich judgment sheet dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the comparison of" "" "Early / Today" "" "is the most impressive example of the provincial capital." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, thus 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Untersendlings houses focus around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flurts from the so-called" "" "original recording" "" "from which the property tax was derived." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no farmers left there today, but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the judgment sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße there were once people locked with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based group Irren Institution" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced in his time and, for example, ended the accusations of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was space for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Youth in the Munich Salesianum meet at the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected in an architectural resemblance to the original works of the Irren Institution which was destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once situated at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second suburban railway line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for Farming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents can occur in the entire state and be noted here," it says in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state that disproportionately aim to give minority rights, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racial discrimination against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recently published report by the office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, showing that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring with money or to let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report, which classifies the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration infringements, which will contribute to further race profiling according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of the Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-place association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and likewise many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengästen comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the BLHV-chairman of Fischbach, he called" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit from such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, a lot of things have to be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental operation and cultivated this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for their support</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-air area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was promoted through Leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss was also firmly established:" "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape route line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will allow for the state-of-the-art subsidy subsidence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a conveyor chain designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area may not be tradable (reluctance over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermen's Weiste fence project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firs Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took on its importance, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is expertly correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the vibratory words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your faint, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the afflicted garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "parent waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they completed a very political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical imagery.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh has come across something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch is not meant to illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is the only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championships" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "your captain's speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh made whole of course were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver medal winner, who will compete in the fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and have chosen me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to platforms.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block the critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the electing of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He blushed with criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" "" "Na, and?." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to defile his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and of employees paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor called" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest or arrest protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers put on his lead.</seg>

<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a "Model 3" today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>

<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urcustombuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogbey "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">In addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, was also a splendid courtyard to which the church or the patronage was one and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As emerges from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps, dating back to 1600, confirm this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval village law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>

<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-building still existing today remained a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in a stone belt at the furniture fair, once a week I am helping in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open whole day.</seg>

<seg id="908">The building end is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge of concrete covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="918">This is a side fixing that is also used as an operating track.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian lane should be gone.</seg>

<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger-tact-feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How Foot Ball's Financial Rules affect Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules established in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was funded without big losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to extract Brazil from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar will sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may turn out a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources, which enable them to reach the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had made enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and cracked to ruin, when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP acquisition period running until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini dropped from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly intensify the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG pays the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption payments for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to bypass their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catfish company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority has been inflated.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatari via payments from the Organisation Committees of the World Cup 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have been denied that Neymar's World Cup will be an ambassador and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily be found out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG imply that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke below the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated sales of €542.4 million with a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's march by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last owner of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1173">Chocolate panels are distributing the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>

<seg id="1182">Likewise with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who cast 65,13 feet, qualified for the final fight.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-years Grunge era (as the pre-thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels as if the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"" "" "" "first Day of Camp" "" "functioned surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising variety of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1188">By stepping on the core of the day - middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up - they managed to regain the impossibility of winning the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his grown-ups who now play adults, is less emotional and his parody is more based on the principle of watering, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's, like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand, which cries the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character browses through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy-vicious Plot, involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well known impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dillons's manstache from "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that this franchise might spell as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West EQAS iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-voiced Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching chess on TV as Americans perhaps do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it is often the only one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it is gone, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective" who was rearranged to a lesser length could better deliver his agitprop satire because Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for a promise.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Drugs-Mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in beating the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Konstanz died on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In this context, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and arrest warrants were issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the police ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the time of the same raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 policemen were in action.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug criminality, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, as well as rape and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the constancy of organised drug trafficking in the south-German region.</seg>

<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep reduces HIV transmission to infection-prone significantly.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to taking intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former Bankerin with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "" "says Joanne." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something similar to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my request," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overeach other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steelwork is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper light window from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to keep it working.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units room for all cutlery and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they have managed to increase the floor space while at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which can help create an emotional bond in your home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't fall in the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate in Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and designer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers purchased 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominating personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property of $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of difficulty for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey davit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick during the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jean shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new chief of staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico tells us that the White House's new head of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to fix: bad information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be convinced," "" "said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February with policeman." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officials, to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit has ever been" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have contained no more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed it several times to keep anger away from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from being provoked by Trump Kontroversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - occupied entirely with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of shkanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also receipts from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatic rise in numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a gathering place, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not without controversy in the council at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt estate.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof you have already been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>

<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up widely, explains Scherer more.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he calculates.</seg>
<seg id="1476">Also the outer complexes are brought to the fore-man, that is already clearly visible.</seg>

<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, purposefully interfered in the 2016 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller also took more and more trump private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally moved into the centre and looked for the reproach that the President might hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "the main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether it should be charged." ""</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called anchor clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor in order to invite persons for the hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons involved in the meeting were asked to testify, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign Paul Manafort were talking.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the setting show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end in order to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the constitution of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the" "" "fair" "" "agent." ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed in this way, it was explained in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this raging, accusations against Trump were loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey told a Senate Committee in June, Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the examination.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump mueller wanted to release.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the scarcely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice towers that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research information, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">All in all, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the north of this horseshoe the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete mischief might be disintegrated there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece break at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest shelf-file of the Antarctica after AWI-data with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the broadest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "under scientists, whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly merge, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "" "Our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers are not able to bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the polar surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know earlier.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organization 'Youth Rettet' because their team worked effectively with traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of putting aside the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who oversees their activities.</seg>

<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first German caverns who are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract one could be present online much more often on these markets than to send the Bundesliga to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation of FIFA at competitive level are challenged.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in the normal sport, Ligen has long since established itself in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbel has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick responsiveness.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most publicized cartoons of cartoons, the rabbits of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85 the Argentinean is still drawing and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter because there is too much suffering in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first few years as an artist he suggested himself as a drawer for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The artist was always inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Big, roundish Mordillo characters cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table, works every day for almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and clocks, his droll figures continue to spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on cartoon animation and TV series with his characters.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The protagonist in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos any animal in his drawings - which has a jack-in-one as a counter-player.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminding of drought and because of the disease-borne insects, what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the farm research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on lavender lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf-goats, and in very dry weather there are so many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: enemies, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses accumulate in the whole country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publisher and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Rioodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process journalists cases, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders connected to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely put in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolete and even though the terrain is still more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we all mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks until his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve rivers."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is virtually nothing but silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "rest" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, degued gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to practice journalism without hitting the drugs poison," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard fitting experiments without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "" "for her reporting in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPI award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take over the task you invade as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce Team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best carry out their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret" "" "start and landing ways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The annoyance is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days before was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activist in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, whom the governor himself called not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has spent three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending concentrated on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military assault.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The Valdez office became a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shadowage is common, the results are surprising since the size of the Borealopelta is by far the surviving animals surviving.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals who use the counter shadowing - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong carnivorous behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the Cretaceous period," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank down to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative flaky skin but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just send a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is in sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, who lived tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the subdued armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average around 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater repayment of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the skin stallions are still covered with bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a lottery prize.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it will.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>

<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased through the app of the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Who often drives train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the biggest drawbacks.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need for validation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document that you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the bottoms or big space and delays in controlling their own tickets and at the end the Schaffner takes the time to take care of other matters.</seg>

<seg id="2021">Only one day after arriving in New York City, the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from age 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of people's view, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had seen countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter had joined together with a local businessman who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "Ferrell came to a question:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Torayan recently stated in an interview," "" "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Todestract insider.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browning's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrel's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The Bit Gallery moves the people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While some say to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build on the fact that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the other businesses profit, the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will end with the start of construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible, hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst committed a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly announced diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and landmark sident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit intellectual comment, not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but openly talked about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a graceful, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits unwell on a driver seat and carries a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette buttocks and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal spectacles, which in the course of two years were exchanging several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a cartoon "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president would transform the Overseas's judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama indeed had only a few days after the book was released to demand man's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazing similarly, at least in a biological way, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who will be sought after after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Court of Appeal show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several torches.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called for help from outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of the Human Resources Start-ups is on the lookout to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, to offer specialist groups and demographic groups, to employ employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers to circumvent the C-suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years won with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low approval results - so you can rebounce why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of nuisances in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance-Industry may have more than $118.7 billion worth by 2020, following the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth-cards of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has recorded regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly, like discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope to be a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and pollute the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to support Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitter won $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only used.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more strongly committed to making this business successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointments and employees to demotivate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4.000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kotter International, who has seen the company very much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow your colleagues ask," "" "Have you really listened to me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't worry about why, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, "said Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to re-organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>

<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape guards, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpatrists have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would allow a stepford woman to look progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpatrists have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the site of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female qualities, the allusions to rape, when one walks a step on Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, unsettled one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy forgets with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to a somewhat darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the fringe zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time when women's rights are threatened world-wide in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Handmaid ') is not the graphic images, the meandering body and the cast eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not really women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensibly strict all of us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everybody knows whom she knows, including the Republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a wider context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the cruelly possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be thrown off.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more complicated long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing "normalize," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling apart from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump are in fact a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally safe only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Parks, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twisted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-changing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city won't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics-pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The central park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same plus the option to settle the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only results in a slowdown of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I was tired of having my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">On the eve of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, throwing them down several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecutor's Office said that she was lodged at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study confirms exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers usually get advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of igniting inflammations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance encourages immune cells in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan helps to tolerate more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieu when the same system works with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan analysed a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which had been kept separate, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiombs of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were found six bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them failed in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerancillary cells as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the existing refurbishments are a "successful project" - it is important to promote interior development, not only to open up new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidency of Karlsruhe gave the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military provided to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fireman car and a fork lift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor, the deputy Navy commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 o'clock, and until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground on the plane during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by TIME did not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state ownership for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could harm the determination.</seg>

<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter at the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The site of La League may be interested in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in its pursuit of Neymar after submitting an offer of £189 million to release its release clause, but did Barcelona warn Barcelona three years before the world record incident?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"" "" "" "I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "" "" "" "Domspatzen Report" "" "relieves the relief of Pope brother Georg Ratzinger" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse cases relieves the relief of Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," stated after publication from the former Regensburger bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "on the other hand, the Vatican magazine" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "would be measured when reporting violence among the Cathedral cats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already a part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said:" "" "we like to go to the church and it's a devout feeding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "punches have been a normal pedagogical remedy" "", "" "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abuse cases, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the prosecutor Ulrich Weber from the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of transgressions between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment of the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims often appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence on protective prisoners" "" "at Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory picture of domain master Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist who became more handy when a domain record brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just had eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-birth in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school were also expropriated outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is necessary to reproach him at best, to experience it too late or to have taken first indications not serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as literally "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exposes an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who kept the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which even led to eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only bang with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also distributed earrings and overly naughty boys on the hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excessive consumption of violence at the pre-school, these are certainly bagatels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One asks oneself if it is not more to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context of the report, there was a great deal about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen).</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also include any involvement or co-knowledge regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar with the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is however that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain sense.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scratch-cats Ratzinger evaluate the role of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... Bubes have opened themselves more urgent or more clear or even more open than against their parents, dormitories, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from all fraternity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domain master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "Wegvisor" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, clean: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say once, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were downgraded and portrayed and were appalling, took place all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that was, as most of the witnesses stressed, the subject" "" "pre-school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline there, but there was no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims" "" "estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the accusation remains to have been stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states in the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently win the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the pre-school further punishment is still practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows still.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate that those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "" "Fallacies of Anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrable at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e., ear-cowardings and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time has shown Georg Ratzinger as in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter test also speak to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective, that the domed cats only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless I do not conceal that he led a strictest regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true culture ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not even make a big singer and before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again experienced wonderful, humorous, gracious, deep-believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do something even a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I receive regular contact with him, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to whom they still look up and whom they are almost worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that you submit to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unfair, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
