J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star clear in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or glued on from the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend their time at home , pre@@ m tel@@ ev@@ isions with open crum@@ b and mex@@ ican food , it &apos;s said in the magazine .
for white gl@@ ut , she asks the question of a child &apos;s wish : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston to be seen as a single mother of two sons .

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they were hunting for the feed trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career came to an end .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses .
he let himself run with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sports help handed out the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lor@@ ent@@ leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 18th Prize winner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sports Pyr@@ amid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent .
and so he gave the € 25,000 prize money as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the real Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of those sport exhau@@ sts came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society wander@@ ed to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
the two US presidential candidates , however , are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , in doubt , wants to keep those in doubt small and cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton hopes to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , said : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in that it must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton speak almost verb@@ ally .
the democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly refused by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
thus , no party internal discussions could be given to Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement will susp@@ end it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renew@@ ables of renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ os@@ ed trade deal , both don &apos;t want to sign .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , asking for Clinton .
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp is about to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must r@@ end , then he says he may not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp stands , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who flee their lives almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks out curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social aid in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for single @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are other reasons for the escape in women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , genocide , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tractors for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , mis@@ hes , says B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and mis@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , demanding B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district administr@@ ations are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some reply with no .
there is no such thing in the Govern@@ ments of Govern@@ ments in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone @-@ wing women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press spokesperson for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some community shel@@ ters floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be kept separate from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ n@@ essed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack the privacy or become women and women together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the washing rooms should be separated and accessible to women , is available in the study .
how much women feel this shelter can be read at the rush that the house is located in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors are fighting : demands for new employment campaigns
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes over a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more employment campaigns at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the treaty .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who had been published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official re@@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures that begin at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in Assistant Doc@@ tors of this year , six times cont@@ esting , the first total cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Assistant physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana returned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was det@@ ri@@ mental and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper compl@@ ained that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
my enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable au@@ d@@ acity showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was angry .
Putin par@@ ted and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a put@@ ative friend .
building up its ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erd@@ og@@ an he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire lie clearly in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an primarily needs all the friends whom he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ ro @-@ imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued anger about the sn@@ ail rise of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; by an analy@@ st : two countries that drive away from the West and feel badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents had said at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State will talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank CEO , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced on@@ ly@@ more to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has been dist@@ anced since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer financial stamps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised head@@ quarter and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand and the brand under which our employees are employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched those brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night on his local rac@@ et@@ rack .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori climbs up the che@@ er when he cat@@ ches up his victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career pages
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already collected 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5 years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s narrow vote of confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 was Ivan@@ ov &apos;s deputy , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a cler@@ k and director of the director of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and he recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
see the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust a job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB National Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this item was taken by another of Putin &apos;s close allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly proclaimed himself publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood into the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a communication published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around Pis@@ ces that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals that were sp@@ lined by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four lock@@ ings of the &quot; ceiling beams , &quot; approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ ted cables .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering practice of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th today , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking blast and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or end of the country .
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern Zu@@ bring@@ er@@ brücke ( 700 millimeters ) south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ son , as the tolerances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds blowing the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boat hanging without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it dis@@ b@@ anded when bo@@ oting the boat from the person who was steering the boat .
today someone has watched over these men .
badly injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic liqu@@ ors dis@@ integrate the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he put on her twice .
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life partner of the man .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig , in the coming years , will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a provision has so far been missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also be established in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban residential construction program that will cost millions and still be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er requirements for investors .
regardless of , so Brat@@ mann , whi@@ pped up a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet fully stand : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how is it possible to compensate for the loss of some 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tical spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ running ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back to the price band@@ aging .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the western city , Fri@@ sten runs out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically , one is from the goal of so @-@ called interference .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged districts in only a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect there to be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later there were a series of animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop @-@ up phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ma@@ dness and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ treats every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people , who train every day 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to get &quot; 30 minutes of time to come &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; ble@@ w up de@@ af ears because many public messages for health are boring and coming from people who look mis@@ erable .
however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
as always , there are also funny game per@@ ish@@ ers , who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it do ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its attraction and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
all along the line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ battle sur@@ titles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the individual multi @-@ event engagement of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she soli@@ di@@ fies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited a final test in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ tournament of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future , it is not really true .
part of her floor exercises , including her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last for as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina led light through two turns , the image clou@@ ded .
ste@@ amed beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ tered .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground there was another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her ende@@ aring - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book , became reality .
Ra@@ is@@ mans &apos;s performance was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ cap , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having practi@@ sed her soil , she over@@ came the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ anks , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot dead in the car when listening to music
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while keeping in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a manual fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police told me that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard &apos;s police spokesperson said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks in His@@ panic living quarters within four months .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge he@@ els and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his Alter@@ nat@@ ants , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language which Ed@@ mund was thinking about for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ area floo@@ ds following extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the South of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama a floo@@ ding early warning system was used on Friday while it still ra@@ ined in the mobile area .
the river com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers run slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still connected people from flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight strongly .
he said that he had warned him of another step @-@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Han@@ se@@ atic she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Han@@ se@@ atic said that he and his family members would have all the han@@ di@@ caps and he would be the only one who can swim .
Han@@ se@@ atic said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ anders would have res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , &quot; as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer approached Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rain has been fully absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a lesson in five districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa was attacking 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were now both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were flus@@ hed by the floo@@ ds .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Rupert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses have been reported as floo@@ ding on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ ked by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police announces that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents reported that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was bul@@ l@@ sh@@ red by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Grand@@ mother Del@@ ors Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge he@@ els for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ saw the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the path , were shells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no arrest and police reviewed the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning and that is for more than one reason .
first , I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is the Catho@@ licon , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an American female .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ gew@@ ater and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the peak of this sport , but we don &apos;t see sports classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
they are the last five , because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily come up in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
in these societies , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we need to offer the communities to countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easily accessible gym .
I have set up my foundation for 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable lodging in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international champi@@ ons .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you for starting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors voted at a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July H@@ unt announced plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistant physicians should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and calendar bites , in order to improve the care at irregular hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ person of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant physicians reported last night in a message with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Assist@@ ants have serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and it is agreed to address all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through talks met with the government for reluc@@ t@@ ance and sometimes in de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the result of a promise made by Jerem@@ y H@@ unt earlier this month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , lift up the inter@@ penetration and address the concerns of the Assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the Assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant physicians on the strike chain cover .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to have a better week &apos;s pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the Assistant to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor camp measures achieve nothing of the only little , but have already poll@@ uted teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the Assi@@ stance Committee &apos;s committee and responded positively to concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional retirement , training cou@@ gh , reci@@ pro@@ cal recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart@@ burn risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ ICE regulator of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ ICE regulator of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form pla@@ que .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that block the flow of blood to the heart and cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral sc@@ ams blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , as a crus@@ hing government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , poll@@ s and town@@ houses to have ignored evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of poll@@ s to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a copy of their identity in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address .
the report suggests to apply non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they release their vote to prevent anyone from choosing twice .
whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to administrative documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves not only against election fraud , but is also to protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ sk should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic alleg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which a person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he particularly expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding al@@ arms to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ derly , especially communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ ka background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric recommended 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist can edit correspondence documents in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap elections &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register to be used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as she has left her voice to prevent anyone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person carry out to ensure that they are in@@ discrimin@@ ate .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting .
ban that political activists edit complete envel@@ opes and envel@@ opes of postal sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off barriers to election stations .
a change of laws , which facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ s .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go alone into the cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric goes over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral tri@@ bunal put Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices declared un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was ple@@ aded guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registry departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud legacy , but the wor@@ rying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
mad nach K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have won this week over the French rac@@ er Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T apart from the edge and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ asi@@ an is by far not the only ath@@ lete with gold fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : crew member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
except K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star sc@@ ary , appeared unc@@ anny .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ go@@ er for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similar severe brow@@ s and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter User@@ in stated their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ os at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swi@@ mmer squ@@ ad@@ ored spect@@ ator of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer died &quot; as M@@ ief &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he handed out his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ 200m swimming pool squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to add more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost touch , baby . &quot;
too excited , retired like a pig , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers all over Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by sound and language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig has died ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not cap@@ itali@@ ze that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming @-@ pool for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many asked him
Twitter users didn &apos;t stay back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like cas@@ hier . # disgu@@ ised .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate phrase , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times at the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comm@@ enting colleagues Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added its ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed last night with our viewers to broadcast and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate phrase . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Fem@@ ale Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic Movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about Mrs. who ta@@ sted in the middle of the business sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman with@@ drew her clothes in the middle of a landmark to try for@@ lor@@ ries .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered her as she saw it , pulled her off and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , &quot; she would go back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own ho@@ of trousers and pants and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a dis@@ crete place to do it - she was just there , nau@@ gh@@ ty like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to go out and go out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was observing someone - or thinking about the person who could buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone would take shelter with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to draw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled her out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a narr@@ ator from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him somewhat safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a nearby distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker gri@@ pped out of pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as she direc@@ ts the gun on him .
with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist them so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
shift the weight on the weapon at the same time and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the gun from its grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k threw his train on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system .
before the check @-@ in of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of rej@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to dish@@ washing of toilets , the task definitely placed its immune system under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a lumin@@ escent number of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the umin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to refuse , after their lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands show less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; showing the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Vice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he &apos;d li@@ cked out some of the things I instructed him to lick up like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , plug it in , and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we &apos;ve recorded some of these fil@@ thy goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ im@@ itation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ usion with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had holes perfor@@ ating , wooden plan@@ ks were torn down , tr@@ ash was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for domestic administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered to be not such a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their call is also not@@ orious .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive crying , stri@@ fe and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn apart .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing prompted her and her partner to forci@@ bly leave the estate this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ u@@ sions were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were rec@@ alled for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a del@@ usion is always the final step taken into consideration Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police and members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information we have provided .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ u@@ ding on the floor
house@@ keeping workers will now have to clean garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after she had ple@@ aded guilty to the property of a drug class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee skel@@ eton , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are del@@ o@@ ating ten@@ ants who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row , by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , said that del@@ im@@ itation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall &apos;s police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal put in panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent military jet is flying over
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces placed an incredible crash
the air forces announced that it was on a training flight but insi@@ sted that no security risk was present
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage shows how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section of Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they started to worry about the noise of the nozzle dri@@ fts without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the bad visibility , the jet flew a little bit deeper than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces ins@@ ist that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , where also four people came to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his view
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Ma Long in an own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
with this , the World Ranking Celeb@@ rated the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ alist tournament and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ ł@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the Final Game and made the title among each other .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time outs , they had no aches .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ ectors on top of one another in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches up to now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said to be logical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless enough breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ ć@@ ani won the match for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had a ri@@ b injury in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , after that was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , a very high table tennis player Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp eliminates ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success are now growing in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty of false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he revi@@ ved his well @-@ known media .
ro@@ cking Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ United States in June , Tru@@ mp and his competi@@ tor were lev@@ elled by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
also Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ ton &apos;s advance again : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or I will make a very very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything else than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to strike funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey data .
instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans wanted to get stronger under the arms for Congress .
Olympics : tri@@ vial fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after a frau@@ dul@@ ent attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function had announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village gave a pri@@ mal sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ etter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leader Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF launched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to carry out its own investigations , divided an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , released and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become the World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed the ath@@ lete of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly was arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation for the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences since a long time .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 Dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , an unusual warning was made that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had done in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this sport species was systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the bat@@ on of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminds with sad@@ ness of her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; ( laughs Bart@@ oli ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago their family experienced their death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in the event of a victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate of Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats want N@@ ude Calendar for &quot; Women and For Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differs from Old@@ school play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men . &quot;
I do it for women .
apparently he is of the opinion that it also does the Calendar .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community pays off with mass flight
&quot; those who do not fit and praise Erd@@ og@@ an are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany soon anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believed the president of the band Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the attempted put@@ sch , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has already covered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions just months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey are fle@@ eing .
after the vain put@@ sch , still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which takes up refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the band accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ otic cities .
thus Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the discharge pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the band called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move as sharp as Austria to Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not fit and praise Erd@@ og@@ an are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sa@@ ils , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ drew Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers accredited because of political persecution in Germany .
as of June 30 , this has been 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and there@@ with just under 29 percent of all people who are entitled to asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the Parliament elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year .
because more stupid than so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ame ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of votes , are only lab@@ orious .
until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania has to pass the election campaign almost over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
what is exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign of election , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and talks a bit with the people , just as his legendary Fred E@@ storff also did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , counsel@@ ing gets cold feet and Chancellor Merkel sets the blame on the thri@@ ving of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to big @-@ nat@@ u@@ sions ; Angela Merkel &apos;s electoral circle is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Sax@@ onia as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority in other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual electoral stands on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so Kok@@ ert , thinks , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that on the ground , you crum@@ ble the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are walking like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral warri@@ or Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats were recently at 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the election in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of holiday misery and publish their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , Green electoral fighters embar@@ k on search of domestic vocal ch@@ ords under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the pointed nom@@ in@@ ee , is straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end only at 8 p.m. there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the start of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
the reci@@ proc@@ ity of the responsible for the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for instance when it comes to the establishment of housing entran@@ ces .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asion by the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy head office manager Florian King , responsible for the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping routes were looking and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas deterior@@ ated .
since the speed limits were not observed , the municipality has increasingly called for the trade fair from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself competent on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest speed was 77 hours per hour at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg , the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales collap@@ ses leaves anyone you ask you to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are thus produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drive shaft is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest is the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be glad about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue shr@@ inks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; road marking has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to let him go .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt said on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much has been handled .
for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic control , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also elsewhere nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his stem @-@ cli@@ ent@@ el returned to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
laws are constantly being bol@@ ted on behalf of comb@@ ating terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ sen@@ status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the disp@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ power anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of the results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks in Würzburg and An@@ sbach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little bit of time to present his conclusions on security in the Republic .
but they are now all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that are not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U husband ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not require any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
some of them have in themselves : he plans quick methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ting people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of alleg@@ ations for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tioned .
man@@ ches also have an in@@ deli@@ ble effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of An@@ sbach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high levels of refugees .
and things that were deeply affected by the people could not be cl@@ apped at election times even in election times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner security has been shifted enormously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and An@@ sbach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ b dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister of the Interior , in which the departments also require a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère ar@@ gues also here for conci@@ li@@ atory tones .
he has nothing to depart from a double @-@ pass .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ juven@@ ate it is not sensible .
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections to a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it is only necessary to show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things in it , which could take care of quar@@ rels .
but the SPD is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen lightly gets off lightly .
despite all diesel sc@@ and@@ als , deliveries worldwide are rising .
however , not all markets are running smoothly .
in the call@@ back action there is verteb@@ ra around a term .
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
Europe &apos;s biggest car is still able to present a plus in spite of its many brands and some good running markets in spite of the diesel generation .
but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened its total sales , as announced in the D@@ ax company .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide .
in Western Europe , China , the second most important market in China , sales fell 14 per cent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buying back &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted put@@ sch in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is further off by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition drop from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales pl@@ ush from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles around the world , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated a software crash test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
during the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , the autom@@ aker makes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I am not talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal refin@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported , Volkswagen weigh@@ ed its German customers now a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting does not take place and all type approval relevant vehicle parameters remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after retro@@ fitting , customers can get into a workshop with a motor damage - and this can result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , comes to a uncertainty about possible warranty rules as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future pen@@ al interest rates - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see it in this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to be afraid to pay for their austerity pun@@ ish@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are spending money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent criminal charges .
this fee applies the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to deposits or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he has be@@ ware of 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for each million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now further determined by the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle .
letting the cash simply lie down in the banks of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the CFO .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing substantial costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically lasting not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
with interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with her Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bank@@ ker said , on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is more luxuri@@ ously endowed with the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it be@@ ware of free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no other banks known to charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ ativity towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to compete .
the customers in Germany will not like this in terms of width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before you hurry to comment , to sow it under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ aven@@ ue males middle @-@ aged men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not limited to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ alg@@ ie .
those who have recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely group of buyers .
there is also no horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ sti@@ ckers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I am in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit , before I stay , hold my hands and say something intim@@ acy like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , that I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vices .
WE@@ Z , 25 working with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records .
from the conversations I conducted , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of adher@@ ents to the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some disk fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evoke bli@@ ss@@ ful memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of con@@ sol@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s like a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff fle@@ es from a pile of disks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record are not a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I plan@@ ed through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly getting in .
foot@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the gram@@ ophone records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged teenagers .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthesis of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ist Pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but mental trauma is hard to det@@ ach when you stand next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
she is more like a window mannequ@@ in than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression that jeans are mu@@ stered pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are not considered , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security bum@@ ps through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while keeping an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of any middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , to tear down .
during a trial period this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes were to be paid and which harbor a risk of fire and stability .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that temporary businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the demoli@@ tion was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Café &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - following a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and continue to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is frank@@ ly difficult for me to comment on yesterday &apos;s journey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in silence what reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Championship in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers from Vit@@ ronic in Wiesbaden can be used , for example , to accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary templates , there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is observed .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days at un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across several tracks .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through pro@@ hibitions according to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sweat @-@ resistant outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ender from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also being used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain ob@@ tains silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
the Great Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle on Thursday evening when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the Death stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the heavy defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji might have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they only get lost one .
this stage will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and allowed the attacks of G@@ Bs to blast out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was kno@@ cked out in the corner .
Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner with another four minutes of playing time .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a squ@@ ab@@ bling T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a takes a touch down in the right @-@ hand corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ start and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while the UK is still un@@ learned .
this is how it is .
GB performed fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whist@@ le sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked terri@@ bly into the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown for@@ wards the bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing victory
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al gold than in those games and that wants what to say .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve which went into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was omni@@ present when she stro@@ ked for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ beaten work , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of trium@@ ph@@ al to ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , it is spreading everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
that &apos;s how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stir@@ ring morning with it and trying to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anyone , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to make some rab@@ bit .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity taken care of
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the big water producers .
so it was a time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken served the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Rupert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Pur@@ pose Board , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 m3 of water annually and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congregations of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ tah .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ na &apos;s Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Rupert G@@ öller was appointed a water @-@ wart in 1985 and was appointed as Managing Director of the Con@@ centr@@ ation Association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and one has always added innovations because water has life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for 31 years .
he has been using a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he has lived the water @-@ purpose band@@ age as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller , on his part , praised water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a loyal tu@@ ber .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens threatened by the sector from green electricity subsidies are of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German steel industry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( W@@ W , Friday issue ) , remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sur@@ charge in the German Steel Industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are sub@@ stituted in the steel works , an EEG @-@ conversion rate of 20 percent applies .
but this also won &apos;t be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity production .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely written .
the successful attempt of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading trade , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation was further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European producers reject price dump@@ ing Chinese steel groups .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little more relaxed .
on the one hand , im@@ pending import duties on imported steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
unclear is how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been more stagn@@ ant .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as steel industry on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the presented quantity went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp to her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German sen@@ iors &quot; league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who regularly calls for his lungs is not so fast from the powder in everyday life .
even if it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher significance , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , dementia suffer@@ ers are in@@ capable of long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a particular achievement is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
focusing on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
even older people who live alone do not just concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I am better and watch@@ ful beyond me - strengthening this experience .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
he who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens to it when a sound comes next to it ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone singing from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one simply can join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ al choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively to the cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the rep@@ airing of cat bab@@ ys has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the male also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the patho@@ gen degree of cat bab@@ ys at the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to lau@@ ts of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the cri@@ es of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily ra@@ ined fry for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the M@@ H@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a call from small children who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey a arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even in the case of suspen@@ ding the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch .
there are no translations available .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r .
according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ glob@@ r is to be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is bl@@ amed by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the attempted put@@ sch .
it is true that the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has virtually no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy orph@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Great &apos;s Great in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive especially at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne demonstrated his athle@@ tic value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion for the record master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South per Li@@ g , it was only sixth in sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cont@@ ini@@ ek .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was bor@@ rowed from the AC of Florence under the contract and announced to Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as after the coup attempt , had not returned because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the storm would have to be willing to reno@@ unce around a third of his annual salary valued at 7.5 million euros , &quot; Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als of med@@ als at Olympia in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had already been banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ gger Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other leading Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had been su@@ ed for a dop@@ ing barrier shortly before the games , was pi@@ tied and laid out mer@@ cil@@ essly at the start ( 100 metres of breast ) .
there was a sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scene : with a smile she was still standing in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
as determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm @-@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than ever before . he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong too@@ th@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the 2012 Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European champion@@ ships from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the banned voice of stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ led@@ geable intake and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two former world champi@@ ons over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als later .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he received the likewise recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgement of the International Sport Court of Justice , CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km going , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still be launched in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , clu@@ es were found to take a banned dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) fell mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but had already left this .
she planned her home@@ ward for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , as Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to police , a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two bla@@ sting sets went up again and another man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police figures .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban population .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives went into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
after all , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g requested several injuries on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast .
it was assumed that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamic revol@@ t movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid .
in the past few days , the authorities would have kept secret notice of im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks st@@ alls .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the current bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ un@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to pen@@ alise chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta that had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest assured itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rising rebellion of Muslim rebels since many years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok were killed at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloo@@ dies@@ t assault on the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also set up the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said principal officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ären &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority was closely aligned with the authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical move &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertising for your own cause .
propaganda ought to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports from several German states about contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ aries &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said that he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind may only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not apparent .
with a view to the clear increase in rights of rights and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee housing , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism .
but we have found in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ ter@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further right @-@ ster@@ oid groups or small groups form , who plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the susp@@ ects of asylum seek@@ ers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who perhaps were politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records not always determine head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight swi@@ mmer of Ethiopia became so slow that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his CV with a reset of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds above the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the race led by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a race over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympia for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp does not see the threat of election so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already made an alternative video .
he then desc@@ ends into the holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp lost the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tru@@ mp said .

mail increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post office is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been testing whether they are to sell their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other farms .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , for instance by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon enter into the mass production of the vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and deliver a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ ors came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the world &apos;s number five is facing a personal new start .
GF@@ RP CEO intends to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the Management Board of the Board of Directors will take over the board member Gerhard Haus@@ print@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to name details .
who will lead the market research company in the future , is still unclear .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the time of the shareholders the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the forefront of Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the latter bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder becomes un@@ steady sometime .
&quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; it meant .
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the previous year &apos;s quarter .
in relation to the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros fell by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the s@@ unken value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the Group &apos;s turnover of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had achieved a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
in case of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Aur@@ ich Land@@ kreis district ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , informed the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to diver@@ t her information to an opposite truck , which drove partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus dropped from the street to the right and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as reported by the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the bus &apos;s location , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ance cars came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the veter@@ ans and possible witnesses to report to the police .
from 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of sewage will amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased no later than once again if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ level calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household , Kul@@ mb@@ ach &apos;s Office of Agriculture found that under@@ cover works for these san@@ itation systems .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ ig@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative director , Herbert Schmidt displayed the body , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and / or under@@ cover from the previous period of calculation must also be compensated .
according to SCH@@ MI@@ DT , SCH@@ MI@@ DT GmbH explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the previous period of the calculation of the calculation , all three installations were not least due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses in a substantial scale .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the wastewater facility of Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ enk@@ ahl , the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and at the L@@ opp pond water plant , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed out after almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge is dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; in addition to these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewage treatment in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully carried out . &quot;
according to Schmidt , the market community has been spar@@ ed from major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious based on stone houses , especially since one cannot expand the utility area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal wastewater treatment plant in order to not extend these facilities because they are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first one over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of July ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; Lei@@ sure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ de .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised in the past criticism in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week struck a filter for some users who gave them s@@ lot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ lowing face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it had disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism rec@@ alled the filtering of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose T@@ we@@ et was widely distributed over the photos , was that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and least said to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yel@@ low@@ back face has been moved to the degra@@ ding extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ kit@@ ten .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could rather assume sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the adjusting practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part of white , just male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors working there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently focused a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ divided population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence service , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground , reported an examination committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Defence Committee , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Military Commander , reports on great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret services analy@@ st who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically derived from high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indication that government tips have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superior laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com belonging publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the post @-@ intelligence reports to bring down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are being conducted by the Secretary of Defense Secretary of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of post @-@ intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of post @-@ intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; definite political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ com analy@@ st .
C. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ ing military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to mention government agencies that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com &apos;s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of the women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is pending
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of those people who keep their gates in mind .
but that knows it : the Americans lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Brit@@ on who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group leads .
as always the game may run on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , became a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work set in London that we now have .
we have fully ri@@ pped the helm .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the close @-@ up area .
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the Cross@@ bow to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partially in the shade are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol arch@@ ery , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the swimming pool and may it rule long .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so spar@@ sely in the past 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline , and until 2012 there had been an ath@@ lete who made it to the final lap .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending bo@@ unce - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially combines it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , har@@ dening and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympi@@ apro@@ gram &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are assessed according to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the public olymp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in the broadcast : the world or the Olympi@@ ah@@ ar@@ ord .
the target @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir one spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel as something ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she bo@@ unces , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves far away , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the qualifying and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon blocks from 14@@ .00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear @-@ monkey and the objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male American gymn@@ asts have recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to be drunk .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
the demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at shot @-@ ups .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and extended to more and more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security guards hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the depths of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ al Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who have been forced more or less in recent years to use tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of per@@ spir@@ ation beneath the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , originating from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 per cent of the population , dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special agents to treat opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for a relatively unclear reason to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to the analysts , were apparently sealed by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ dic city , led by Tig@@ ray , attacked businesses and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for scheduled flights over Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp declares that Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple @-@ repeated statement , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly to the American public .
it also brings his fellow @-@ stri@@ kers who endeav@@ or to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , statements that he might not have meant .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp broke back in terms of the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp intended to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism le@@ ashes down to Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton chat@@ ted about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he pronounced strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s enam@@ el , but later he said , &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an additional tone , since its survey values have gone further .
a recent survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries not to excuse themselves for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave himself a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements on whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is in this sense true that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back t@@ ames , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to expand aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being taken over against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a small cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop@@ front were displaced .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a city of gent@@ ri@@ fying .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change then it &apos;s also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions .
there are natural cycles .
the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and regularly visited the club .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave up coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and culture in the club that liked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the club in 2003 Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tended to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ shop would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for ingeni@@ ous del@@ ectable delicacies from Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane tiled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fast snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ acking , this was the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which suff@@ oc@@ ates the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the country of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food residue , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noticed , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar mixes were tried out because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction took preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive on mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - have changed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and to turn p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold@@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x .
he was a great reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Ms Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country got back on the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there was the incident of the wind .
after the plates arrived at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roosev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss humble recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;

killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bombing of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , which , according to the Picture @-@ Newspaper , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people life .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian protecting him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symboli@@ sm in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children cannot play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to strike terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland H@@ arks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research vessel , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic .
Greenland H@@ arks will only get up to 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average exactly 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which for verteb@@ rates means a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed that Greenland &apos;s quar@@ ry would become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland H@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface .
researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland hair .
they measured their slow motion , when they presented six animals with a transmitter in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 cm long , while the largest measure was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear tests carried out large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers would be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
the record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as possible early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources into a long life .
building plot in double pack
the community at the recent meeting focused on issues relating to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board accepted mayor Robert P@@ utz &apos;s announcement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the land , plot and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for survey were clari@@ fied , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; street l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , volunteers can now report in the town hall as of now . the public council is expected to deliber@@ ate on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to meet also requests for settlement of further industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the Council decided to change the surface area plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has therefore the best opportunities in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract reloc@@ ated work@@ places and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the IC@@ W &apos;s financial markets and property markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary homes continue to operate from London for financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is enough for them to appro@@ ve the approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are using just large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the biggest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk corporate ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg holds a large fund of funds , it &apos;s just as bad as Dublin in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city has easily available commercial property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class industrial property rose by 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultants Merc@@ er , the city is standing on number 7 , Luxemburg at No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba by the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Jud@@ ge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , U.S. official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to lower costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to match Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained of each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ CS ) pi@@ er@@ ced after the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians , held as ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters joined the D@@ CS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we &apos;re leading up on clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign officer Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections were not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions concerning assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his forms of business and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already jump@@ ed on the issue and published a video on the internet on Friday , asking the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax declaration .
on Thursday she addressed the subject also during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton is supporting a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who pay more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat , Tru@@ mp replaced a meeting to discuss their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return by year 2007 .
Clin@@ tons , who live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the U.S. tax declaration from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were paid as a salary , unlike most of all Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going inhabited settlements in people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , who had already had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by practi@@ sing volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent Vi@@ erst@@ u@@ fen@@ .com method to protect their houses and harvest without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the &apos; World @-@ phone &apos; Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ating of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is twi@@ sted to the ignition coil .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst open with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer which shoots a gol@@ dre@@ ad@@ work fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council decision unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk reconstruction at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are taking part - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expand@@ able .
however , the application for the new construction of a sales ski on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bank in the construction of the Rhine , however , was unanim@@ ously rejected by the town council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli choice was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin hasn &apos;t listed Israeli pre @-@ election since Arab guests had requested a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s selection list .
the country was , however , not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked for the pre @-@ election to be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the Internet where people knew the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
some of them subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have yiel@@ ded the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it in another post pointing out that the hotel , located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not add Israel to the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a narr@@ ator of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police pus@@ hes tear gas &amp; rubber stor@@ ef@@ ront to prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police introduced tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against prot@@ esters .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to police rubber and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er spra@@ ying on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been reli@@ eved of office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian enterprises take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade fair is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan exp@@ ires a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representative spent about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl nu@@ is@@ ance
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been practiced on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the su@@ sten@@ ance of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , returned from the staff of the beverage market the issuing of cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police do not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , thus relatively small .

Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical daily group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their care@@ gi@@ vers on their summer@@ time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ loving group was quartered in the first school holiday week .
several full day tours were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to B@@ loo@@ ster with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maul@@ bron@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
the culinary delights of children and car@@ ers with their own body@@ work such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops there was b@@ atik , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game .
other highlights of free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and you@@ ths returned home satisfied .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the soul care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were met together .
in order to bridge the time until the next novel pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the Federal Minister of Education St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was given to the open gate of mercy to Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms , arose .
in the evening before , the parish priest sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the crosses and gave the pilgrims a blessing .
from Hor@@ b was driven by rail to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage path from Münster began .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening from a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches were repeatedly asked to sing a song from specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ass@@ ented for a tasty and energ@@ ising dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after this was the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to climb around 500 al@@ timet@@ ers at first and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint gri@@ lling on the pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the late afternoon at Freiburg Min@@ ster and passed through the gate of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a little impulse .
at the evening Mass in Münster , Min@@ is welcomed by the co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by rail to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite gets gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead , who had made his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . the J@@ ump made the legend very proud when he stor@@ med his home to conc@@ eal a victory from the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the rail@@ road world champion@@ ships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner finished the qualifying rounds in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first lap .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du fell short after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ di , when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
in the final round , we set up a Olympi@@ ah@@ ord and defeated the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the victory in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des admitted that he was deliberately dropping on the track after a weak start .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection of England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an expression of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal contest of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four kilometer race .
they reached the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won Gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he fought with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which continues tomorrow and ends , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ ell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were reduced .
drama was playing in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director , Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton , was in April in the middle of Sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ pen@@ alties and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus aboli@@ sh all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy specified for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in a closure .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects since the melting process uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zi@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ ash with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , informed that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the earnings of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual budget of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting mill or to guarantee the power supply to the melting shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the sector before the potential closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements made by the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity a year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and 4th daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , scre@@ ened reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é story almost every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos; clock ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate somehow in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
K@@ any@@ e &apos;s big sister Kim loves what the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered out before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are mod@@ elled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Ms J@@ en@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the bu@@ ggers of the moment . &quot;
these feelings once again bo@@ iled up when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but going around on the mis@@ fortune seems to be passing by at the point .
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her spare time she is seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centres reject 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief organisations are exp@@ elled annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry insi@@ sts on the effects of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and the like - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality that are already busy are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is envis@@ aged that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the Municip@@ ality Centr@@ es of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers has shown that thousands of people are exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need will be refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been wrong@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need will be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government filled its promise to raise funds for legal aids on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp El@@ ection Camp@@ a@@ ign after Staff allegedly drew We@@ ap@@ on
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s Camp@@ a@@ ign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after she was told that her Camp@@ a@@ ign for North Carolina directed a gun to a staff , while she was in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i agreed to have waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vincent &apos;s Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compl@@ ained to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the In@@ dict@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to harm damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina said the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapons bud@@ dies - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judged as judge .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence .
ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tru@@ mp &apos;s press spokesperson in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before countries elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could barely go@@ vern , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin .
in both provinces , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iles shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were back in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survey , the SPD in Berlin just dropped to 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still lag@@ ging behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates , on the other hand , would miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weighs almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which today would range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in western pocket format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , albeit tor@@ mented slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market domin@@ ates today providers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday for a lot of people everyday .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were sold for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app vendors and the telecommunic@@ ation groups .
a whole industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had seen the night .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the saws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered to be a curse and a blessing .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from playing .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such people who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the two @-@ minded people were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each question asked .
as the Olympic Games He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of fun growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is backed by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ oleum &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook told us that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the code regarding his advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the site advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle between the time @-@ fixing open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing have been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
according to a recent study from Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display block@@ ers around the world , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users operating on Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company has refra@@ ined from using ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs account for a large share of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to control people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that blocks new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focus on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide transfer to Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call upon witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred from several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred in the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that at the age of 49 , a Swiss woman , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , which promp@@ ts them as well as any witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing , after killing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the court .
the Court found that the police -- who responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a NASA climate model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus expon@@ enti@@ ally increases its daylight side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planets expl@@ orer .
although it was probably hab@@ itable once , Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans were evap@@ or@@ ating and their water vap@@ or was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy drew back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations at the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations has to be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was ranked as the best trainer in the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 in the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was struck in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ öl@@ Labor@@ ers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles concerning the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all the party parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this week , Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the star @-@ pile at different rates and in what context the rotation @-@ periods are associated with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other Stern@@ enh@@ aufen we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star @-@ pile , which were created some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars encounter large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Candi@@ date of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has granted him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrac@@ tee on December 31 , 2017 , he will in future act as consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez has paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the resting @-@ hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for as successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star came to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have taken banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was banned for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even enjoy a favour in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and later said to the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , had sympathy with the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston red so@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters chanted by the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; caught up : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Poland in Rio will not be able to start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an enligh@@ tened ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events are known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Tar@@ z@@ hin@@ sky were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires a strong co @-@ operation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is not responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news reached the positive trial of Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on for the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substances are supposed to act as an EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been exp@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , approximately all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case was also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both of them deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the entire Russian team up to one exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan race produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in swimming sports , the previous off@@ ences in China had also caused violent confron@@ tations among athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also focused on a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but only had to sit down for a three @-@ month lock .
data E@@ ger : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programmer of black@@ mail malware is currently attacking companies - and are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the companies sur@@ vey@@ ed in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators special@@ ise in their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching an alar@@ ming rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the paint programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of Bit@@ coin Cryp@@ tow@@ att .
but where private users represent the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopp@@ ages .
the damage is accordingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware goes .
22 percent of the German companies reported sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany many hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ackers , on the other hand , know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers at F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ ma@@ sts and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partially negotiate and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ackers become more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their pollut@@ ants in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ boards .
the existing malware @-@ Kits were created by downloading malware , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is a fitting tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ma@@ ges then search for further h@@ ackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on saving Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful pen@@ alties , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things to the grain .
at the chi@@ pper conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper side falls down somewhat .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with elevated and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ ets and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceilings .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision @-@ war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temperature regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top dies@@ els are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline not to be held liable : crash on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable if there are dangers that are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee @-@ hood during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of disease : when should the organizer be paid
after their trip , sick leave will only get money back if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family had suffered from diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ key holidays .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness returned the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective sewage plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer was only informed shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was ok .
he did not viol@@ ate his duties of information , so the judgment .
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belongs to the general risk of being alive .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and An@@ sbach in July had many people worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if perpetr@@ ators would have to leave the country more quickly , this would increase safety and strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals up to the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ fourth magnitude of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
video surveillance should be improved , the weapon &apos;s right to be improved so that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is difficult .
the last much discussed per@@ spir@@ ation for doctors is supposed to remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior is clearly opposed to action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the papers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a ban on bur@@ kas and the abolition of double nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid what you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Simone Peter submitted to the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate action and action with new anti @-@ terrorist packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way feeder
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal ab@@ sent@@ ing should be extended .
this is a good news for all car @-@ drivers who are in traffic on the environmental road every evening when they drive via the motorway via Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) , the road construction sector will el@@ ong@@ ate the road between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ el Straße by 700 meters .
drivers can then navigate directly from the hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic divi@@ des in the early stages , thus improving the overall procedure in the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the train nerve irrit@@ ates the drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ el Straße .
from here the traffic is guided only one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rec@@ alled a good one @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge did not have the required load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to absorb mainly heavy @-@ load traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related work @-@ day traffic will continue , the competent national business can not say .
however , with years to be reck@@ oned : the bridge has an official rest period of the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ dity the country has deliberately chosen the bu@@ si@@ est time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is expected to be expected .
traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday on the construction site .
cultural Journey : culture Opport@@ unities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ima &apos;s and Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most young people in the class had come to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Vo@@ id , and the Junge Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December young people with and without refugee and migration background , between the ages of 14 and 20 , will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has taken the Star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke through the bill in the southwest of Germany during the night - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of star@@ ches in the sky .
the zo@@ di@@ ac scales are per@@ il@@ lins , which are one of the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep long before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be based on them , emphas@@ ising Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eping , member of the German Society for De@@ generation and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands among them is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an on@@ e- and sleeping disorder .
as a result , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , a member of the German House of Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs are stuck .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors condition each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , checkout .
the draw@@ back can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - domestic demand .
there is hardly any low @-@ level sleep medi@@ ator in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , if you have problems with sleeping problems , you should contact your GP first .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for investigation in the sleep lab , doctors advise for example snor@@ ing with respiratory failures , in case of illness @-@ fatigue , sleeping @-@ conver@@ ters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dressing , you go to bed for a normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows sleeping .
how can affected people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can sit for better sleep .
the checkout counts on : regular sleep and up@@ time , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not watching TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on right away , and this is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team from Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has provided protection against his ex @-@ team colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € award and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see it as closely or even operate on dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked the choice Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice @-@ cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : ban@@ de of luggage sealed
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 was successful on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 9.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants recognized a gang in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past thi@@ eves .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and were in a joint , edi@@ table and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Police Office 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves which had been submitted to Germany exclusively for the prevention of criminal off@@ ences .
at the same time , they captured a total of over 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , a few cob@@ ble@@ stone streets in between , the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like that , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one walks along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a grey house someone has spra@@ yed &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , it is already being built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred in the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator handle had spoken out several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who brings up three children here , is mainly general from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the Hau@@ schild projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z that mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ alizing left .
the tren@@ ch that the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police open between house occup@@ iers and their neighbours obviously don &apos;t exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty .
also house occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from around the world over the past few years : people from the GDR times and former Haus@@ ser@@ et@@ ers share their neighbourhood with them .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on the cast pan@@ es or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences like body injury are according to statistics , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences constitute property damage , which tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for acts of violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that .
even the famous burning cars no longer admit it directly in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to Riga street - and stayed .
that is why it was also so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the street will continue to be taken away : with fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former spaces that drive the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - people living here are rather people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neue geb@@ auer has little understanding for people who are angry about colour bombs : the Hau@@ schild and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub quarter who can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their real name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the management team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else interfer@@ ing with .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group implies that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ ch@@ le is now there , the urgent wool @-@ milk @-@ sau , which above all has a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write down the place .
looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , we@@ aving an ice @-@ lying wool @-@ milk @-@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organisational , human and defence problems .
soon new containers are placed in the washing line
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rats@@ amt to the Commune and the Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments .
so far , it was not possible to rely on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be intim@@ id@@ ated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centers , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who have to be found or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it will take and they can bridge time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling some@@ day , he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not want to work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problems , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they both fear@@ ful of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk may and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also the subject of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region .
they always kept in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy to integrate the previous human beings wis@@ ely .
these are about 100 people currently , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
