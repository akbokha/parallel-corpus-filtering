<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="9">And with that the riding career came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself run with his family about the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even bother for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed out the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Goldene Sportpyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential candidates, however, are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump, in doubt, wants to keep those in doubt small and cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton hopes to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive back regulators massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, said: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that it must be invested, Trump and Clinton speak almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly refused by the state-critical Teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, no party internal discussions could be given to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement will suspend it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewables of renewables with its investment programme: "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transposed trade deal, both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, asking for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump is about to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rend, then he says he may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump stands, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was detrimental and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper complained that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable audacity showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, since it was committed by a putative friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up its veto becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly in hand." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends whom he can get after he has been relieved of his office at a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agro-imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued anger about the snail rise of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus that after the attempted coup d "état, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" by an analyst: two countries that drive away from the West and feel badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents had said at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's narrow vote of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has ordered the release of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who since 2012 was Ivanov's deputy, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was a clerk and director of the director of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and he recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">See the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust a job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB National Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another of Putin's close allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensland crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four lockings of the "ceiling beams," approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering practice of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth today, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking blast and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or end of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern Zubringerbrücke (700 millimeters) south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A provision has so far been missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet fully stand: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how is it possible to compensate for the loss of some 1,300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning olitical spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-running ties from the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later there were a series of animations, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop-up phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokemon who are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person retreats every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to get "30 minutes of time to come" from the sofa "and" to be active every day "blew up deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and coming from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also funny game perishers, who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast erklomm on Thursday for multi-battle surtitles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the individual multi-event engagement of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while she solidifies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of overdimensioned expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi-tournament of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles fetched the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the Team Coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises, including her typical Tumbling Pass - is attuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gymnasium where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a series of victories that will last for as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina led light through two turns, the image clouded.</seg>
<seg id="27">Steamed beams and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title - lautered.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground there was another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her endearing - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raismans's performance was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old man-cap, which is called" "" "Grandma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After having practised her soil, she overcame the audience of Kusshanks, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix, while keeping in the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, said the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a manual firearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told me that the threefold murder would not have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker didn't take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesperson said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks in Hispanic living quarters within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which turned on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge heels and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened with large-area floods following extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>

<seg id="22">Hanseatic said that Nothelanders would have rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated to Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flood had spread rapidly, "as there were heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turning and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is the Catholicon, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an American female.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiagewater and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman, who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the peak of this sport, but we don't see sports classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the last five, because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily come up in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these societies, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to offer the communities to countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and easily accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have set up my foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable lodging in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the young high-quality gymnastics who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic Team Gold and thank you for starting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from office</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and litters of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw his train on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the check-in of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of rejecting the rinsing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to dishwashing of toilets, the task definitely placed its immune system under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a luminescent number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the uminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after their luminance was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands show less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," "" "showing the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Vice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming, which ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he'd licked out some of the things I instructed him to lick up like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, plug it in, and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we've recorded some of these filthy goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social apartment after a delusion with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had holes perforating, wooden planks were torn down, trash was spread on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for domestic administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in that way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is probably considered to be not such a beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their call is also notorious.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive crying, strife and flukes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing prompted her and her partner to forcibly leave the estate this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delusions were cheered by facilitated neighbours who said their lives were made hell.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were recalled for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a delusion is always the final step taken into consideration Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deluding on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to clean garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after she had pleaded guilty to the property of a drug class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee skeleton, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="6">A Kenyan function had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village gave a primal sample under the name of the 800-meter Letter Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">IAAF launched the IOC for information about the case in order to carry out its own investigations, divided an IAAF speaker.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment," "" "said it in an IAAF declaration." ""</seg>

<seg id="18">The world-anti-doping agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Parliament elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because more stupid than so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the electors, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflame balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of votes, are only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to pass the election campaign almost over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign of election, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and talks a bit with the people, just as his legendary Fred Estorff also did his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="8">The reciprocity of the responsible for the construction works is also commended, for instance when it comes to the establishment of housing entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt said on a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to comment, to sow it under the pseudonym non-avenue males middle-aged men with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not limited to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to Midlife-Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horror by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turnstickers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I am in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit, before I stay, hold my hands and say something intimacy like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, that I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vices.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 working with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I conducted, people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of adherents to the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke blissful memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation" "", "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "a staff flees from a pile of disks." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record are not a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I planed through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound record, so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly getting in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Footopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the gramophone records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts newest synthesis of synthesizers and sexist Pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but mental trauma is hard to detach when you stand next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more like a window mannequin than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives off with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression that jeans are mustered pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they are not considered, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with security bumps through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while keeping an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of any middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, to tear down.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial period this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes were to be paid and which harbor a risk of fire and stability.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that temporary businesses and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "more than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids" "" "Café" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" "" "the closure" "" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants rated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - following a steep increase of newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor: in different federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailers from Vitronic in Wiesbaden can be used, for example, to accidents, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to renovating bridges with temporary templates, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is observed.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days at uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across several tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as drive-through prohibitions according to time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Great Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the final hurdle on Thursday evening when they were struck with a result of 43-7 at the Death stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The heavy defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji might have beaten a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only get lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and allowed the attacks of GBs to blast out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau was knocked out in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner with another four minutes of playing time.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A squabbling Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua takes a touch down in the right-hand corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while the UK is still unlearned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked terribly into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown forwards the boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinal gold than in those games and that wants what to say.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 tough Hieve which went into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was omnipresent when she stroked for the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter unbeaten work, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal to geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>

<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it is spreading everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>

<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 m3 of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the congregations of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Bauntah.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairperson, Breitna's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed a water-wart in 1985 and was appointed as Managing Director of the Concentration Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budgeting planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land acquisitions in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the repurchase of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and one has always added innovations because water has life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.</seg>

<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp to her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors "league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly calls for his lungs is not so fast from the powder in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher significance, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia sufferers are incapable of long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a particular achievement is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's own voice and rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people who live alone do not just concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I am better and watchful beyond me - strengthening this experience.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">He who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens to it when a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone singing from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one simply can join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesial choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two blasting sets went up again and another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation in the vicinity of the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police figures.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing an urban population.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives went into the air in a flower bed in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang requested several injuries on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon at the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was assumed that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombings carry the same signature," "" "said Army General Danai Kritamee Friday morning in front of journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamic revolt movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the past few days, the authorities would have kept secret notice of impending attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks stalls.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to penalise chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta that had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest assured itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rising rebellion of Muslim rebels since many years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago in Bangkok were killed at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the most bloodiest assault on the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>

<seg id="1">From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of sewage will amount to 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased no later than once again if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-level calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household, Kulmbach's Office of Agriculture found that undercover works for these sanitation systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Weligahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative director, Herbert Schmidt displayed the body, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and / or undercover from the previous period of calculation must also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to SCHMIDT, SCHMIDT GmbH explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the previous period of the calculation of the calculation, all three installations were not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses in a substantial scale.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the wastewater facility of Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welenkahl, the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond water plant, the first sewage sludge had to be disposed out after almost 20 years, the sewage sludge is disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "in addition to these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewage treatment in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully carried out. "</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Schmidt, the market community has been spared from major entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to remain precarious based on stone houses, especially since one cannot expand the utility area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment plant in order to not extend these facilities because they are deficient institutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" -Effect as Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have criticised in the past criticism in which they were accused of promoting Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when this week struck a filter for some users who gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "yellowing face." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filtering of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely distributed over the photos, was that the filter was "vulnerable and least said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowback face has been moved to the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperkitten.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's great audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could rather assume sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the adjusting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the large part of white, just male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence service, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, reported an examination committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Defence Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Military Commander, reports on great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services analyst who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-based information, typically derived from high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government tips have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superior laws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom belonging publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the post-intelligence reports to bring down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are being conducted by the Secretary of Defense Secretary of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a moderately restricted process for the creation of post-intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, as Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of post-intelligence reports," "" "damaged the morals under analysts and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Centcom analyst regarding a" "" "definite political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector who received complaints from Centcom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">C. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honouring military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to mention government agencies that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But that knows it: the Americans lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Briton who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group leads.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may run on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, became a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work set in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have fully ripped the helm.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a backstop from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guided tour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we're in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the Crossbow to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partially in the shade are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol archery, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swimming pool and may it rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparsely in the past 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline, and until 2012 there had been an athlete who made it to the final lap.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially combines it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, meaning" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hardening and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official" "" "Olympiaprogram" "", "they are assessed according to execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The public olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in the broadcast: the world or the Olympiaharord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The target-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir one spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as something tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves far away, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon blocks from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear-monkey and the objectification of male athletes - as the male American gymnasts have recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to be drunk.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">The demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot-ups.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and extended to more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the depths of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberal Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been forced more or less in recent years to use turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of perspiration beneath the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, originating from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for around 6 per cent of the population, dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 at a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well-versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special agents to treat opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for a relatively unclear reason to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which, according to the analysts, were apparently sealed by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in the last months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amhardic city, led by Tigray, attacked businesses and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for scheduled flights over Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Donald Trump declares that Obama has founded ISIS" "" "sarcasm" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple-repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow-strikers who endeavor to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, statements that he might not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump broke back in terms of the allegation on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump intended to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leashes down to Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton chatted about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he pronounced strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's enamel, but later he said, "Of course I thought the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "" "" depending on how the reaction expires. "" "" said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert, who observes the language of both candidates. "" "</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an additional tone, since its survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A recent survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries not to excuse themselves for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave himself a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements on whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is in this sense true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back tames, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being taken over against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's apology than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once pushed over the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a small cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shopfront were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a city of gentrifying.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempted and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change then it's also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages like capers and saute onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural cycles.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer anymore, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed through prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and regularly visited the club.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland Harks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland Harks will only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average exactly 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which for vertebrates means a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed that Greenland's quarry would become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland Harks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion, when they presented six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 cm long, while the largest measure was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear tests carried out large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters would be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as possible early as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The registrants from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were met together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next novel pilgrimage of all the registrants in the next two years, the Federal Minister of Education St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was given to the open gate of mercy to Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruene, Haigerloch, and holy rooms, arose.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, the parish priest sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the crosses and gave the pilgrims a blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by rail to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage path from Münster began.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening from a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches were repeatedly asked to sing a song from specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights the parishes of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller assented for a tasty and energising dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after this was the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to climb around 500 altimeters at first and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint grilling on the pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="18">God thanked God with a little impulse.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the lead, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen. the Jump made the legend very proud when he stormed his home to conceal a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the railroad world championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner finished the qualifying rounds in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu fell short after his turn, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindi, when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up a Olympiahord and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the victory in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately dropping on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindu said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the area of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (apparently holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an expression of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal contest of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won Gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which continues tomorrow and ends, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama was playing in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director, Shane Sutton, was in April in the middle of Sexism and Mobbingpenalties and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolish all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy specified for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects since the melting process uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelziei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smash with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that three more owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have come into effect as of November 2016." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the earnings of AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual budget of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of termination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "Ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting mill or to guarantee the power supply to the melting shop" "" "did not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the sector before the potential closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements made by the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 MW and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity a year.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché story almost every birthday septic of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o 'clock), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kanye's big sister Kim loves what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>

<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the rolling 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered out before the official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners likes success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenner's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the buggers of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings once again boiled up when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But going around on the misfortune seems to be passing by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Antonio Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit tormented slowly.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook told us that his desktopside would change the code regarding his advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the site advertising is.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-struggle between the time-fixing open source community and the bypassing have been in progress since the invention of display lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exponentially increases its daylight side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planets explorer.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable once, Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporating and their water vapor was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in the star-pile at different rates and in what context the rotation-periods are associated with the planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other Sternenhaufen we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star-pile, which were created some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these mature stars encounter large amounts of constellations.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aging, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star-pile of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak up their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "caught up: because of a positive doping test," "" "Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski" "" "from Poland in Rio will not be able to start." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">An enlightened athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping events are known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacles in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Tarzhinsky were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) applied for the opening of the B trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires a strong co-operation in the investigation," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is not responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, the news reached the positive trial of Danekova, the 33-year-old went on for the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substances are supposed to act as an EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should also have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported criticism of the athlete's athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been expelled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, approximately all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting athletes, especially the case Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world association IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian team up to one exception because of systematic doping, even the Kenyan race produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in swimming sports, the previous offences in China had also caused violent confrontations among athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun also focused on a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positive in Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimulant Trimetazidine, but only had to sit down for a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Eger: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "programmer of blackmail malware is currently attacking companies - and are successful." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes several victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise in their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching an alarming rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the paint programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of Bitcoin Cryptowatt.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users represent the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stoppages.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is accordingly higher when a ransomware goes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies reported sales losses through ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany many hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "declares Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers at F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmasts and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partially negotiate and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware extortion, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackboards.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware-Kits were created by downloading malware, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a fitting tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmages then search for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on saving Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful penalties, the perpetrators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things to the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the chipper conference Defcon demonstrated security researchers how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>

<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesels are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is regularly stowed on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal absenting should be extended.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep long before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes may be based on them, emphasising Hans-Günter Weeping, member of the German Society for Degeneration and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands among them is the insomnia, so an one- and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the German House of Medical Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially common in a depression," "" "says Weeping." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor, checkout.</seg>
<seg id="19">The drawback can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any low-level sleep mediator in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, if you have problems with sleeping problems, you should contact your GP first.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in the sleep lab, doctors advise for example snoring with respiratory failures, in case of illness-fatigue, sleeping-converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After dressing, you go to bed for a normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can sit for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">The checkout counts on: regular sleep and uptime, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon right away, and this is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on Facebook to disappointing the DSV team from Olympus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has provided protection against his ex-team colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €award and a jungle king 150,000 €, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," "" "wrote the 26-year-old at night on his Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming-sport is bad, but the doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see it as closely or even operate on doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I do not say that the controls are to be set here," "" "he explained further." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency in Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WADA / FINA must not participate," "" "asked the choice Hamburger, who meanwhile operates an ice-cream parlor." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">The arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 was successful on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and baggage steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9.30 p.m. civil servants recognized a gang in the area of Dusseldorf Airport, which was known to the policemen from past thieves.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July of this year and were in a joint, editable and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Police Office 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves which had been submitted to Germany exclusively for the prevention of criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, they captured a total of over 15,000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, a few cobblestone streets in between, the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that, but the police counts them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one walks along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a frescoed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone has sprayed "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already being built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "" "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred in the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner senator handle had spoken out several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the premises.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who brings up three children here, is mainly general from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the Hauschild projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez that mostly wanted police protection from the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench that the Berlin inner senator and the police open between house occupiers and their neighbours obviously don't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polls from around the world over the past few years: people from the GDR times and former Haussereters share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on the cast panes or freshly painted façades, which were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left-wing Autonomous Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences like body injury are according to statistics, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences constitute property damage, which tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer admit it directly in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you can help each other, live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the street will continue to be taken away: with faceless newbuildings in former spaces that drive the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many - people living here are rather people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neue gebauer has little understanding for people who are angry about colour bombs: the Hauschild and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub quarter who can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their real name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuchle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else interfering with.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group implies that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuchle is now there, the urgent wool-milk-sau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write down the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, weaving an ice-lying wool-milk-sau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine's client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and defence problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are placed in the washing line</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to the Commune and the Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it was not possible to rely on private dwellings, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed residence, there are internships, training centers, school grounds, one-euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who have to be found or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help home master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it will take and they can bridge time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling someday, he can't help in Urbach, do not want to work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, says customer honestly, "people with whom nothing goes." therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they both fearful of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "what some may call naively." "" "a residual risk may and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also the subject of the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always kept in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach, we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbach is already busy to integrate the previous human beings wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are about 100 people currently, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
