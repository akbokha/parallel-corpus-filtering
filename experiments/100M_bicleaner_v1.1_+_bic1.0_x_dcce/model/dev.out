Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing Israeli settlement and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two further deterior@@ ated by Obama &apos;s deal of Iran &apos;s Iran nuclear program .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress that was partly classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of Israel at that time .
in an emergency call is Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told us with a slightly his@@ sing voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note rooted in a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could reverse it , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police he shot a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has eventually made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police captured him .
one day after sho@@ ot@@ ings at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the Gau@@ tier police , where he died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to a job as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ onic meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in the spring of education .
one of the long@@ standing friends of Lam@@ b described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had obviously been together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ um , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ h when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed two years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ um was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ er Night at night 5 . September last time when Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and were jo@@ king with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation took part in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight ceremony on Tuesday evening .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil vi@@ gil during the university &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected in order to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had called the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had called Pr@@ enti@@ h his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us states that there will not be so many Christmas season associates as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the 2014 Christmas season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business gets near@@ er , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox cher@@ ries over his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ awn and a length of distance from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back to Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ stru@@ it@@ tig is the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon declares his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the fr@@ inge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban sum@@ mon@@ ed five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temp@@ er as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters who are ten@@ ding to Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their guard hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , say four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten end of July put their money on Y@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp harvest the majority support .
he has got 13 points ahead of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have fixed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration of turning and fishing was in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial His@@ panic Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as the in@@ filtration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will apparently also do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans speak in the new Mon@@ days @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ oman .
in the street a square meter of a recycled roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - that is why the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student building in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro per square meter per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky match by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympics Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a confident pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have given the FC Bavaria a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ e hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in his 28th place in the Champions League , Müller was given good help from the Champions League to the Bavarian @-@ leadership ben@@ evol@@ ent Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who had to pass a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ test fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but with their offensive endeav@@ ors often too resour@@ ceful to work .
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely penet@@ rated against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more lucky on the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms W@@ ye Brown beat the poles of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to pin con@@ i@@ fers .
but on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er there was a decree .
so , for instance , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero has given the green light only after gradu@@ ating , said sport director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller was still on top .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of Pi@@ raeus having words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went against the Munich @-@ based tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium .
smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : when doing so , the risk falls rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ der .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to a good dental health even to high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected by too@@ th@@ lessness in the age of 65 to 74 years , distributed the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have indicated that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet on rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum Skel@@ eton and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents , it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of goods tra@@ cked
after a young woman is par@@ don@@ ed in the train station in the train station , the Federal Police is asking the population to help themselves .
on early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 hrs the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , she carried away serious injuries of it according to the Federal Police .
she was treated with emergency medical care and was taken to hospital by rescue personnel .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there are no knowledge of the medi@@ ating officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by of Lin@@ der@@ ner train , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .
notes about the cause of the accident may be given at around the clock and be given free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute about TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to assess the dispute about the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ ten@@ tious private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its operation matches significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are specifically fores@@ een that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens un@@ familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel adjustment to enforce tax pay@@ ers on tax pay@@ ers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act adopted the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
above all , it was critici@@ zed that they are not supposed to apply to Canada ( C@@ eta ) that had already been negotiated .
the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
the Commission took into consideration the reform of key points developed by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is on the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the business opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , continued unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have run since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart pointing to which the so@@ ber acting fol@@ ks@@ man recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells stories from various places he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ously arranged and wonderfully arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ence at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 States states should be ob@@ s@@ essed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ ette of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ ette has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited since his election
the new leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is scheduled to make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ ette and set up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes critics of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several ti@@ dings stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes should take place in order to remove the whole idea of a total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth UK Labour leader , David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subject to both &quot; stroke and stri@@ kers &quot; and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economy Council , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , spokes@@ man of the House of House , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch Jud@@ y Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fragment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the fragment was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Parliament and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires ample reforms .

pound increases by accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound mark@@ edly rose according to data showing an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result grew without any Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and sustained estim@@ ation of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offering of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his rating for the company Rating on &quot; Sale . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages pose a threat to expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berliner luxury hotel on Pots@@ damer Platz .

for the advertisement in the advertising print of the supermarket he scored three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ impl@@ es company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ses .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e would go too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others emphasize that Bie@@ ber was just in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1st place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA Poster brings Leban@@ ese to the potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
it is both - in the potato @-@ we@@ eter developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner , &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wor@@ ding &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had watched by chance on television .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the Leb@@ ese in the meantime brought the idea to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason Al@@ hay wants to betra@@ y the amount of meat and potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ level campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - incur@@ sion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA outlets from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a kick @-@ off campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers embar@@ k on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investors strategy ag .
there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ an &apos;s I@@ GA shop stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ an I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cover around five percent of the food market in these two countries , twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away sales of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine &apos;s high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that met@@ a @-@ ash revenues in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash would disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ to &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction while printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging san@@ itation programs to El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ aka is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s Kok@@ kin@@ aka deserves praise rather than criticism of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ aka was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gio and deserves praise from the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ aka , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; came into the li@@ mel@@ ight by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ gio with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ aka and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f tel@@ egra@@ ph@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ aka von He@@ aly was defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s decision not to take into account the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ gio &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state of emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally come to the country .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people returned from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a serious meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ inking cities of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation , which was wi@@ ped out on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border into Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even jail cups were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entrance into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesperson Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people caught in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of having committed crimes in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos circul@@ ated the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and pressed a crowd to sit down there .
about 20 failed to enter , but thousands were outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head prior to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates .
Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups since the C@@ BS News survey , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
her support with the men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are bl@@ ended with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at the moment - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the voters of the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common response is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman becomes president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioning their ties with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the balance group , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so .
if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
eigh@@ ty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the eligi@@ bility of the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for those elec@@ tors has emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some key features among voters in the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multi@@ tudes consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters typically see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs continue to be satisfied , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in all .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation now , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy among the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters across the country also see Tru@@ mp as dish@@ on@@ est and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp however get good notes on the leader@@ board .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
on the two candidates , half of the voters support in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in a large number throughout the country . support is growing at 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the Tuesday &apos;s survey .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also indicated that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes tru@@ mp among republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ iss , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who &apos;s most pleased with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - with 19 % support with Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side hi@@ res for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values can only be measured in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood exposed to the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , during a sham@@ eless ritual , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood took a brutal attack in Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , leading to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after den@@ g was impot@@ ent and claimed one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle their symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said polic@@ eman Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide items and princip@@ ally set the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly added injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ane of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the first five members for the murder of third parties .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase of interest comes , and the land@@ se will fall into fu@@ elling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so severely that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could see that all the excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a historical trend based view on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that investments yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the retard@@ ation in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after interest reductions of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more detail , in the past 35 years the market is mostly up@@ trend - about 14 per cent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on it starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often support them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only exceeded nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the figures given by Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants earned a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading will only have a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all reduction cycles from 1950 up to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers were set in shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months until now .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticipated an increase in interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares when they change their strategic course .
when bor@@ rowing , the yields appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond issues immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause ren@@ ditions to move closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher revenues , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet sur@@ passed companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rates 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public radio calendar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to change to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I think it is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport for it to kick the commercial ri@@ vals into the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted on the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to fill in the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fight for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spending a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims arrested in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are supported by Muslims in the first se@@ pul@@ ch@@ ings in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of the huge Saudi Ben Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
gri@@ eving , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead oc@@ cured their last journey to the Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the veil of the mos@@ que and then fell to the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king handed down a sanc@@ tion over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the catastrophe , which left also 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 star@@ ters who were killed , when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have left the crane arm unless it was used .
an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month , assembled .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men is over
British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales offices will close nationwide
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men who carry out the work in their homes .
if you can use a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops based on craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our women consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including his management and financial superi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the group covered the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will have 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball Viz@@ in@@ eist@@ ers A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted by this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , had cryst@@ alli@@ sed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
he does the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial loss .
this fact was the fact that the president of the Sho@@ vel Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that at no time an asset was created .
the sports officials only charged expense allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to some 600@@ ,000 Austrian sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue the club or lock it ? &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ winner of the large @-@ company audi@@ tor of the financial ministry .
with his co @-@ defend@@ ant and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said when taking in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is only allowed to make a debt .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance damages has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance damages was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore package and non @-@ detailed bookings also seemed to be explained , the former chairman explained the procedures .
the accounts and accounts managed the two accused collectively , said the second accused .
why the out@@ flow of the association had not been disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial statement , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the year 2011 against which a function@@ ary investigation started for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that would have been set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this security account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage repar@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why indem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to present accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audi@@ ting , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the deport@@ ations had to be done in cash , and from his place of residence , he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the personnel mining that has been running for more than three years , the comp@@ iler will reduce further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting .
the positions in the U.S. Compu@@ te Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , costs of € 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs since three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share declined 2.3 percent .
the company , which has become a large @-@ scale company in the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently emerging : this way , the computer and print shop will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC market as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services continued to last the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer .
sales of PC and printers came back by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
earnings declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive post@@ ings on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mostly be rep@@ udi@@ ated : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves unanim@@ ously .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 per cent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict .
in co @-@ operation with Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of respon@@ dents are rej@@ ecting 20 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29 percent could not decide . &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have applied to the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred brought refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees burst through the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a laun@@ cher .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially deployed Pep@@ per Spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees sack in themselves and suffer from breathing difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press secretary of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is watching when the U.S. st@@ aves come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half the last week of opinion that F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision should be made at 8.@@ 00 pm CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone , and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ um , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 that said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb had supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ h also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ um was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ore would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ er worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ um .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ um , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night Lamb went his car to the side , ran away , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb was awarded a Ph@@ .@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , just like his life &apos;s lau on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against Leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug property .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the approximately 1,000 managers around the world will cost the work@@ space .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and enhances its low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more executive board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
airlines operated under the umbrella of the airline Airline Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the court stopped strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the regulation of retirement for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to reach viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is presenting routes to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own cheap line .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external defender to the crying and will exclude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg action and is hospit@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to escape a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ fighter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the Defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad hurt , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron never knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it wasn &apos;t yet enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the curious , trees fal@@ si@@ fied , thin @-@ bear@@ ded , thin @-@ bear@@ ded beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
pushing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK test cad@@ re and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ e@@ ers are oriented to results .
there was no question mark for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test person gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first started Jonathan side@@ walk in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us at Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and get four qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een maybe hasn &apos;t done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar An@@ s@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what is said before .
Gary &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember how players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy falls into a lu@@ te by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ gor@@ ged ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises such as the EU is now and not always full of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually don &apos;t want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to see Britain outside the EU tent outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long expos@@ ures such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they weren &apos;t during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
in all his back@@ war@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone h@@ acking foreigners , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ newcom@@ ers who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas be distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum whi@@ rl@@ wind , as Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
the press has never lost it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ ies , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps have traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ one tendency and the wild servants of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everybody .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried on TV to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet mates , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ supporters and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ endu@@ ms campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ial Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the Left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious sel@@ ections - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on the start on Monday that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; based on P@@ he &apos;s most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed check of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ lined the BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the Tob@@ acco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to be@@ zeich@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ He report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative danger in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people per year die from a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up the East@@ er@@ time , says former boss of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ern@@ ames and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think of a good idea medium or long term , you should at least focus your production on programs that others don &apos;t do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible level of support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ law TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ ern@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; ni@@ ches &quot; programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue , if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think we all think that for 150 pounds per year here is a great value , but for people who are for the $ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening , and enter@@ tained &quot; to public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound signals .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled from frac@@ tures of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , found it out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
if it applies ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with stim@@ uli of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are visible at bus stops and subway trains and require a second look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important notice : drive from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the picture of an arm@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising campaign for the Ce@@ MAT - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic advertising campaign , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains sti@@ cky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is a stepping up of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors make fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ getting 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you are coming , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people get .
the rooms of people often turn into beverage recep@@ tions , film nights event locations and local meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and make their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ room stroll culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you must go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ one of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it a sm@@ s instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps from flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of sp@@ le@@ en for your tea too ?
check this with the Mil@@ k owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to make a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb it belongs to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors for something to make a bit qui@@ eter for them , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5@@ pm , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they let their own music upset , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse acci@@ dentally came into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be too much embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future wife , to divor@@ ce her , to divor@@ ce herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she over@@ comes all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future wife , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good tripod is funny , but it only takes some moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never def@@ rau@@ d someone &apos;s room with too@@ th@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ oss your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ person , Ger@@ ing@@ sin@@ ner
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses in Fran@@ con@@ ia @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need cam@@ pers , but also the alone mother and the slave ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a large part .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when one puts people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .

it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily transformed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
did the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legally , I have gone through my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is especially complicated that there is always an im@@ pending d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Pit@@ ches Ord@@ in@@ ance .

it is still subject to those who create three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
guil@@ der : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely does not vote .
but do you not tough@@ en up the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the alone mother or the servant ear@@ ner .
I show you how to build even today even cheaper and well .
that is why it is .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght comes back or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may be the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more likely by stream@@ lining the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and this may result in a crash of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; established three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by the chairman Alfred Klein .
thus it is possible to record chess players who cannot bring up the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the centre of Alten@@ markt Anton@@ isti@@ ft opened themselves under the clo@@ ak of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can also participate in courses .
the Social Fund pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office recently opened .
right next to the shopping market , there are now sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have been able to ensure that often nursing homes are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the citizen hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the sal@@ ine was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the salon complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ af@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the view of both women directors in demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ scored at the inauguration celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the unification in old age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the Foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 a.@@ m .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellec@@ tually , he did not conc@@ eive .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the Bre@@ mer inner city when he saw a parking gar@@ rison out there for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wiese was then stor@@ med from the shop , insul@@ ted the officials and repro@@ ached them against the feet as reported by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the premises of the petrol station there were also three persons .
one of these men was crying out to the young people and struck him on his face .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left off his victim .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed by several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male figure .
with the help of a dru@@ mming , one was beating on the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the wounded had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
up to now , only a vag@@ ue scene description is available .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and noti@@ fiers to contact the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes practice of Fel@@ is@@ breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on his way to his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms before years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to step into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to dwell in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in a voluntary work in the DR@@ K readiness of breaking hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is working as a hous@@ et@@ ologist , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle themselves as hous@@ et@@ akers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy thus comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and need a speaker room .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mill@@ ers receive a total of 50@@ 000 euros as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients enter the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in every quarter , in the North German A@@ verage practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Mu@@ eller : the pharmacy stays in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour continue to look above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the clean@@ ability of the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends an era in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Ed@@ sel mun@@ zel@@ ingly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly already percep@@ ti@@ fies them after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue living in Hohen@@ amo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband compl@@ em@@ enting : &quot; we have a plot of 6,000 square meters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - ref@@ using Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously notified that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany in order to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is what this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister pointed out , Slovenia wants to limit its borders for refugees but not barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ lav , on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that previously had Mig@@ rants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was it for people to approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had travelled the entire night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to the postpon@@ ement of the already predicted displacement of the Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west@@ ward route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , stressed earlier that his country prepared appropriate plans for possible delivery situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently acknowledged the country &apos;s standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic attempted to calm the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high level of refugees at this time .
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatia War .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were reported to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further defend@@ ants in the event continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteer workers .
while some fit spontaneously to the chal@@ k and read the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; suffer long suffering , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the fr@@ inge there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live in a responsible manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Mannheim @-@ based Di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical Work , which is the carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex earnings mixed , Financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the fiscal year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 US $ .
the lower sight comes in spite of the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ ly transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields sound yields , considering weaker economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analy@@ st asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has experienced a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation shipments , which brought the sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter turnover increased by 29 percent for bo@@ d@@ ging transport , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in freight business .
in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited conference in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the loan for the first time for almost a decade .
above them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero @-@ current interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Represent@@ atives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which im@@ poses itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far removed .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed Policy sustain@@ s the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would ease the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago the F@@ ed seemed good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although creating jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued their currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , where the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation when raising interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ at Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed became the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere reference of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow down her monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets up for an increase in interest , made significant decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible impacts on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives vo@@ iced these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aside aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is altered , I do not believe it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .
yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car section if you need motor oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les .
if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has different taking options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more .
the meat counter is extensive , also the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even cook on request for you .
a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef and g@@ all , pig @-@ natural dar@@ ms , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more .
who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals .
the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking space .
Nag@@ yk@@ öl@@ ked : hed@@ ged building site in the outskirts
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves teaching with her 74 L@@ enses .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS is trying to inform women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried authorized the construction proposal for the 2.3 million Euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ lon@@ ged gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ arena is moving step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
prior to that , the Panel had decided , among other things , an application for a construction law &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid building plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form relating to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with non @-@ mit@@ ek first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned utilisation of the roof area for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the cultivation plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with respect to the roof inclin@@ ation - although the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally rather restric@@ tive in the case of a liber@@ ating application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project between the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ large hall is now presented to the Federal Council for Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the start@@ ling plans of the Land@@ kreis district , which confirmed Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the conven@@ er conven@@ es next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases at the inside station .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to agree to both houses , will continue until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ele , which has 35 beds , to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs , according to which the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ moving bodies in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer says about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no real perspective for the house where fishermen worked as head doctor for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ ball of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .

Jag@@ ger with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hun@@ ts@@ men were in action , as the police rus@@ hed .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was not clear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Police ) was established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing for Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police rus@@ hed on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also captured on Tuesday evening , is deemed to be very susp@@ icious , who indeed conf@@ essed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquaintances among the missing persons , there was finally a suspici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the authorities to stop the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought forward on Wednesday to the o@@ at fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him .
a decision on the near@@ er circumstances of the act is to bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against a lack of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution conflicts in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing onto a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be ready in Germany this year .
that &apos;s why 14@@ 0,000 homes are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accomodation .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant failures in housing policy in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany is pushing a housing deficit in front of itself , which will grow from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in case of emergency in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were reluc@@ tant to stay longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mom@@ my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , tax exemp@@ tion tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed housing is suspended .
in addition , attractive fiscal amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support program for refugee accommodation at the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia follow the corridor
after Hungary there is practically no going through , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia aims to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to Slovenian Interior Minister and when necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have gone to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws , which came into effect on the same day , are also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country in Croatia in the morning .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees don &apos;t come across borders .
for this the border crossing bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are supposed to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before closing on Monday there had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make it possible to overcome and damage the border zone as a crime .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the condemned threat of arrest up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the exhibitors were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
in practice , however , no one has a view to grant asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier panels were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps was rebuilt in the bor@@ der@@ land .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government data .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with ti@@ dying after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance to the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Middle of Passa@@ u .
previously we have only su@@ c@@ tioned the un@@ hoped guests once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try over the border .
the regional train , however , was shut down at the Inn in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing generally is high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a two @-@ brid@@ ged run spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further quot@@ ations to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for privacy @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ strong quarters
with the introduction of the refugees , Konrad sh@@ ined all his hands .
Christian Konrad lived that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first tak@@ eover district of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great f@@ uss , Konrad said and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ rad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had discussions with the local tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it runs well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar will support Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that district owners have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in terms of accommodation , Con@@ den@@ ced Con@@ rad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
the Republic does not inc@@ ur costs as stated in the Republic of Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
until now , the own search for neighbour@@ hoods has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the moment no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can currently be accommodated without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has cor@@ ded further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assures me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding limit controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , the fact that Austria is now also introducing new controls is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial area of Linz is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - as Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R &amp; T invested € 1.7 million in the site , 3.@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria country and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
actually , Jutta Sch@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown in the form of another business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , were fascinated by the idea of a location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has got Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman is in rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional lady cannot answer with the last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag gets upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ up .
whether it mani@@ fests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , re@@ prov@@ okes journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cutting off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 population centre are related to it via -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sp@@ ies , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to give Tru@@ mp &quot; a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was lau@@ te , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the l@@ ender , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and a local for gold dig@@ gers opened in the USA .
cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate company was first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the country for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , belonging to the Pal@@ at@@ inate at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes pronounced statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish , it is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more distant to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ anding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm describes how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz came to a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they make it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ daughter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinema @-@ singers , also in the USA w@@ akes the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park was awarded the award for soft tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dor@@ sal Alpine Club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominated the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the liber@@ als &apos;s leadership , but there has been no major shifts in the Today reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was included in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers as Sunrise recorded an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sunrise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today reported an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was at the beginning of the year .
until now , sunrise has 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning man more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter &apos;s star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 arrived .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident N@@ ine will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will finally prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to persu@@ ade Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets un@@ v@@ eils ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded into greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have chosen ly@@ rical ways to explain why Wood is the perfect man and , in doing so , called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the under@@ graduate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly recognised both themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noted S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously wasn &apos;t just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a triangle as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ dun@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Elec@@ torate &apos;s parliamentary group conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
actually , entirely different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ toral Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum is over@@ stock@@ ing the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did it during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy should not fall under the table .
a long term endur@@ o remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school of three to four years will be tested .
but this is not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools who want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

the German stock market has closed with winn@@ ings after a long stretch of direction @-@ free and nervous trading .
only in the afternoon was a firm pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .

in the U.S. , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to appear on this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for a large decline .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has pressed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and left deep traces on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered something , but ultimately losing 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , investors currently have little attention to the German chip@@ maker .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber boots on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber missi@@ les into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ elastic district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police took tear gas and then fired into the air before returning to the rubber floor .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber missi@@ les used , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the age of 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled over for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ator voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re @-@ built .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the grounds for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
what investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
however , no contracts had been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner large street , already purchased a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning of the holiday houses at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , rig@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investors and managing sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the ten to twelve million euros invested in this project has been in the discussion for months .
the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building called out the heavy reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , member of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a huge block that overlooks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus@@ ses must come for this to be calculated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the well @-@ hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans were still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund to raise the $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ tax@@ ing the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to making a donation request on his blog .
instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million were doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn by Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was totally dis@@ b@@ anded and 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison to this , diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and partially at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who undergo an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted more conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop the violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ orable , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence and that brought about unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of proceeds of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 , the toxins control centres rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants for a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , few sp@@ lashes of alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the tox@@ in emergency centre in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection agent in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah &apos;s Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fragran@@ t disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally prescribed by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ur@@ ned her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in the New York State plan to poison their &quot; gem@@ ental &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the tel@@ egra@@ ph@@ ed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a collision on the cross @-@ section between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ dem , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was easily injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver was driving on the cross @-@ lane towards the industrial area and was too late that two vehicles had to stop at the roundabout .
as a result , he pl@@ ung@@ ed with his truck into the rear of an audio and pushed this car to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involved vehicles resulted in a damage of around 10,000 euros , shares the police with them .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ri@@ dden and had to be tow@@ ed .

D@@ ons increase lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ m in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the d@@ unge@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was dismissed spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show cli@@ ma@@ xes of the Celtic games any more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars by Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the ensu@@ ing departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , which is now at the top of the table with five points margin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago pointing out that he hur@@ ried out some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic destination Mich@@ u with return reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , has indicated that he can withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires with the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pl@@ agu@@ ed with a bo@@ ther@@ some kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the passage from Wales this summer .
heard on S@@ FA Battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was cancelled later - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on any performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ to@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with flu@@ ffy lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident happened in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to spin things - but it is conf@@ essed that the decline in the field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will put the boys back on tro@@ t again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Cul@@ es is happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league win , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Cul@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that haven &apos;t won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is rising in the UK overall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) were shown .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the exp@@ ir@@ ation
since the security staff was unable to make peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .

why I &apos;ll be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came near@@ er , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as there are often more applications than places available , there will be a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery instead of deciding who will be elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of prisoner as he likes it and you get access .
I complain about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he was persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a home @-@ peace event in basin @-@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben cous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he referred to Ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s Integr@@ ity Section and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ t@@ amp@@ er rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I must think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had let die bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point of view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ folded Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was the case yesterday .
but it also had so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested by driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man on the weekend after a clas@@ h with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back against ri@@ vals due to claims for ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League Fav@@ our@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson replied that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm player &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team earned the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him confidence , because they worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and obviously he has a great team to train , so he probably won &apos;t get used to it , so it was a shock for him .
it is funny how this time is appearing again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of a cra@@ p about it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Game .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos probably was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and no points of tension ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final round in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ us with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on drug delivery
a man who could potentially have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a ref@@ und@@ able deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 k@@ gs of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused at the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café might have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three truck participating trucks had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left , as the police rus@@ hed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing plan was completely demoli@@ shed .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping bun@@ ny .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches used to search for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and he then said to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; attorney Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was ref@@ unded in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ dges do@@ dge to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up away from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs left people from fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were transferred to the German side by foot over bridges and traffic jams .
there they are received from Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said one speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the city on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists are warning of storm rivers in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical strain &quot; Henry , &quot; who has been drag@@ ged from the Bermuda Islands to the Atlantic in the past days .
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ sea @-@ circle with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 hour @-@ kilometres are to be reck@@ oned .
on Friday , the sun can look back again for a longer time .
the mass is making it : every two years , the autom@@ akers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is above all a movement among the compact cars , which are currently very well selling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registrations have ac@@ counted for this segment alone in August , according to the German Federal Labour Office ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars will be presenting many new compact models .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not much more expensive .
Opel presents an introduction below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
in contrast to the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will be new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ ri@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ n@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ scored sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan driver wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti adapts perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications of 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented themselves mainly in front of the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ designed and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was especially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and was first integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants on the IAA in the compact class , such as the modified Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the justice @-@ law firm Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged for months in a cell that was too small .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to the information of his lawyer , now is on his free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his office of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin did not fail .
however , the constitutional judges raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case back to the trial .
they see the human dignity of the man wounded .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
although for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , an equ@@ ation of compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they said only in April a prisoner of indem@@ n@@ ity because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommodated between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of staff in the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore always surrounded by 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to mal@@ let it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ en@@ elle , 21 offices in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of up @-@ to @-@ date , 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Economics ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of residential space , however , is dramatic : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the ten@@ ancy agreement , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little , from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be born and the Federal Government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them start their care@@ ers , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the integration of refugees is crucial if they find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ one , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence Light , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - mostly the view is enforced that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the construction of networks is the Royal Road to work integration in view of the throne of the Royal Road .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the de@@ mar@@ cated parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ tem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries students without knowledge of German language will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
student @-@ willing refugees could become easier to access the university .
for refugees with a refund or cancellation do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law more if they begin a study .
in principle , the latter do not receive a ban , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to vote .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and further develop the existing state @-@ state law to a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights are also duties .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act for a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ ole showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees currently awaiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is demanding to hire health cards right at the time of registration .
services rendered could be deduc@@ ted later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ er law prescri@@ bes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , doctors tend to create language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in doctors &apos; sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
but many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic look .
in the case of refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
but with the partially other diseases German doctors have come from their training , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical shortage , the refugees possibly even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
however , to be allowed to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly pass tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill , according to the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
vulnerable children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ sed in Germany .
anyone suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ hes and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sc@@ ru@@ th@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent symptoms of chronic illness , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices of mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus promot@@ er invites you to day@@ dream in the man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ staging .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift for enthusiasts is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cocktail cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinces by talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates audiences with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films the Cub@@ an du@@ et wants to take up loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
except through numerous sal@@ ted sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes of each wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid JU@@ MB@@ O , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or a 200 people , we always do our best and we are with all the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by MPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech by calling them .
in the past month they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to bo@@ ther Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that immunity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ ri@@ cher , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a company statement .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that tight @-@ focused businesses provide a better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is surely uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then reg@@ ained its old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; L@@ ess said .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere six years ago since his debut .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to list most of the vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability of the last season will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a decent period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will pursue a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening with Din@@ amo Zagreb ahead of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself to a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favorites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , where 3,@@ 2 was measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the far @-@ away hope to lead the association with his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; L@@ ess said .
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with their emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though the isolation is actually dominated .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more deeply .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy luck .
the beautiful thing with Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone chap@@ la@@ ins told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suscep@@ tible to suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest

di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion the way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only striving for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was replaced later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , who could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was cast out in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ended up in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up close to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps @-@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some f@@ laws and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he put his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Mary turned into a spin , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short of the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth year of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago in front of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona back then .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion League winner , four times champion League winner , two times club world champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered user of FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ y@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to remember : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has won me with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns were running in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of movies
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she isn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke down when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the line @-@ up of the film and not in the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown responded , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian encouraged themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers &quot; colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove which is beaten by her white balance .
the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on said that her direction could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against mis@@ endor@@ sement of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter users expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 with a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement was nation@@ ally effective and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to use discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums have still their meaning .
in more recent times , the leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ils who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crown first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who finished all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , up to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first Ath@@ lete to finish the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge fully three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful prize and life changes , it gets the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth relay , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers drag@@ ging past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained its early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inner ring 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ round at the end of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer , Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen to a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the major league in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe played a Double Play
after adding a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two batt@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the vulner@@ ability before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers scored in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat well , but he caught the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z expi@@ red due to injury to the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , due to a shoulder de@@ formation , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing from the 20th of August because of a cen@@ sus on the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees arriving in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ha@@ sted on Tuesday evening .
it counted 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an capital were prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , according to the government president responsible for the initial survey , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the determined reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective elimination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup had passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls Southern and Eastern borders
after Germany Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior minister , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there had already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann jointly requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a common action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start on the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee protests in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who would need protection .
but those who don &apos;t have a perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this opinion was intim@@ ately divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced to tie down the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling prot@@ ru@@ sions over Romania , the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean at Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice cap of the Saturn &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sp@@ ars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon is stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this di@@ ver movement is only small , but too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing 1860 München for several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 1860 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must abst@@ ain from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duction violation of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to mean four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must now think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sport director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the six@@ ties presented a Def@@ en@@ siv@@ mann as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .

despite his initial fears , he remained without a serious ble@@ ed .
no di@@ eting fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line will often fall off from them .
man@@ go contains relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gan@@ ese contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support the vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney adjust@@ s well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the U.S. package service U@@ PS will once again provide up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States .
the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , shared U@@ PS on Tuesday .
above all drivers will be sought .
last year U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 people .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have made arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had received harsh criticism of the parcel service .
first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then marked cold front
in the coming night in the valleys of the southern side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland was hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n sometimes blows with a storm force through the fo@@ eh@@ ement valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest @-@ current .
on the northern side of the Alps , on the night to Wednesday the F@@ öh@@ n is breaking through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows until Thursday morning in the spru@@ ce valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in particular in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can pass through to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair drops for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away at the alpine slope .
here rain starts to stop until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has to be expected in the next 48 hours .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n exhau@@ sts the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ proof rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind will fres@@ hen up to stor@@ my air , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a mad@@ man .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle .
Luther then had initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the decline of power .
hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the respective themes can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
in doing so , he has been fascinated by several partners immediately : this applies to Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today , translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible quote and a set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lor@@ ds Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up that , in order to be able to bear my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re @-@ emphas@@ ise art in a quick@@ ened time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants viewers to get into the images , letting them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art has been : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but selected the topics that were important to him , including mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opening in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X trains
plans made , place found , companies mand@@ ated to model earth hill for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway there was an end .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused devast@@ ation , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the first community pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still happening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break @-@ break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga starts a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a key role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial course has to make policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some of the Bundes@@ l@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign if they are wearing the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees is everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we football feder@@ alists can , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the European Quali@@ fication Play against Hungary this Friday the Women &apos;s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ sbach called for the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license ver@@ ticals had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is the fact that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses an eye in accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he held in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , p@@ opp@@ y , and then drag@@ ged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue with the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spar@@ es Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he will therefore arrive at the weekend in Singapore on the weekend as little as reserve drivers for the two stam@@ mer@@ es Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low gr@@ ind in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 clock / sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high intensity of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its trunk position on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door @-@ keeper &apos;s position .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of root @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be in use in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the resear@@ ches statement by Mit@@ acher Re@@ us that the final turn for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Middle @-@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l believes : &quot; with that Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic au@@ tos : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the IAA in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and rapid rise to digital radio communication .
to test new technology there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not apply additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use it internationally for example , that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the person as a driver .
when driving automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , immobili@@ zer vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD &apos;s transport politi@@ cian , S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 count on autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
based on current status in the title fight from 25 September to 4 October , Düsseldorf seeks to open only in singles .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ elin , who leads the latter list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has pulled a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and with it he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his attitude to a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the little work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing his training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was spent : to indul@@ ge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers ta@@ sted 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion myself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , which , for example , processed them for blankets and she@@ ers .
that alone is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the pl@@ um lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who doesn &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialist stores and also the wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
exports also weak@@ en , currently in Russia and in the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year , we have produced a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outer office of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that must think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ introduced the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine sel@@ ects small glob@@ ules in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith masters Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to mem@@ ori@@ ze them .
I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not supposed to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays for 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group mand@@ ated by the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use it to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encourage new start @-@ ups and drive forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it points to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , a legal business environment is assured and the market is more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the company and ensure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thereby imp@@ air consumers a much higher dose of the nervous pesti@@ cide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a similar working paper of the EU , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks and s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the catch may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limits .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limits in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant defl@@ ection manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mr Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause especially un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard for the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily driven by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants exp@@ el more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , e.g. in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanent and comprehensive crossed , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted in March from the paper .
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
