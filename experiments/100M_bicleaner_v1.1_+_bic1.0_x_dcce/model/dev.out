Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement building of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two further wor@@ sen@@ ed by Obama &apos;s deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear program .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting with reference to the election ahead was rejected in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call tells Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was rooted in a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police captured him .
one day after sho@@ ot@@ ings at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both included in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university employment policy meant that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard , would be no guarantee for an automatic path to a job as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b &apos;s track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran into the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in the spring of education .
one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ b described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
all the girls d@@ mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed two years ago in a summer fair .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5th for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth @-@ harmony musician finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and chat@@ ted with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil vi@@ gil during the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported to Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected in order to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us states that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the 2014 Christmas season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting near@@ er , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox cher@@ ishes over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ awn and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected movie theaters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon tells his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters who are ten@@ ding to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first constitu@@ ency state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to operate effectively , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their guard @-@ hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , say four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten end of July used their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the final cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support .
he has got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have fixed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they match with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration and fishing began in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they match with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp will also do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new monthly survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; here in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street costs a square meter of a roof@@ top cabin with an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , the price is just like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , noted .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and i@@ dol
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympics Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in his 28th edition in the Champions League , Müller received good co @-@ operation of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who caused a shot of the world champion to happen as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the play at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a focused and dedicated performance without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , among them famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also stum@@ bled at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but in their offensive endeav@@ ors often too resour@@ ceful to work .
the attacks were too often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely penet@@ rated against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown struck off the poles of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to put needle pun@@ ches .
on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , there was a decree .
so , for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New he let Guardi@@ ola defended a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put on it .
before the game , it happened in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially buried Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of Pi@@ raeus to speak with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , thereby har@@ ms not only the lung , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : when doing so , the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ barrel .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ y inflammation in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and v@@ ases and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health even to high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of too@@ th@@ lessness was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet on rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum Skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always a specialist office for archaeological excav@@ ations .
in the third part of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found .
some text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with approximately 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new tri@@ bunal in conflict with TT@@ IP
to deep@@ en the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely envis@@ age that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the US and from third countries .
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other to be arbitr@@ ators , an objection to their judgment was not made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could , for example , also resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which is especially demanding from large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies can enforce damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act have considered the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been critic@@ ised above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
the Commission included key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is of the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic performance of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club of Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart pointing to which the intim@@ i@@ dating folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us on the basis of various places he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ously arranged and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states states should be ob@@ liter@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact on expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live satisfy him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , 2005 appears an extensively celebrated masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hall@@ marks of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not in any year @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens will then rely on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with very extensive electronic selling pieces .
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs came out , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; theatre shows mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;
only for an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens restra@@ ined , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows out under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Prime Minister Fra@@ gest@@ unde since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ction Round , and for the first time he will set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the cabinet cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday , during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several ti@@ dings @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes set out to remove the whole idea of a limit overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pension minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth UK president David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subject to both &quot; skill &quot; and stri@@ kers with re@@ perc@@ ussions and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Estate Minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought up the idea that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the House spokes@@ man , to discuss the problem .
when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch Jud@@ y Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower House and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires extensive reforms .

pound increases due to accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
the pound mark@@ edly rose according to data which indicate an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building objective .
between May and July , the result without any Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and brought assessments on the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - returns to growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company Rating on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .

Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and in the potato @-@ we@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a spe@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ty instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the Leb@@ ese in the meantime brought the idea to the patent office in Munich .
according to the agency , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason Al@@ hay wants to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding of international cuisine is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash starts missi@@ le defense campaign to combat al@@ di@@ -
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell the approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September , when wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and equipment get through its annual investment strategy ag .
there is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine &apos;s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ an I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that , twelve months after the opening of his first markets , Al@@ di will cover around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away sales of all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine &apos;s high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine &apos;s turnover in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash would disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ to &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been down by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on revenues and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and I@@ GA retailers can improve their stores by faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging san@@ itation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ u and deserves praise from the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to strike Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a fight for a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended ste@@ ad@@ fast by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has drawn a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ gios in the important decision not to take into account that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to return to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has quickly made up the ascension on which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state of emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ed the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally in the country .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials responded with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc with a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take up another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbours .
the emergency reached on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even jail cups were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an entry point into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : the illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Re@@ porters of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of having criminal off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos circul@@ ated the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to enter there .
about 20 succeeded to enter , but thousands were outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has deterior@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a major advantage in the older elec@@ tors .
in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections were saying that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are bl@@ ended with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at the moment - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the vot@@ er elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common response is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice @-@ President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so .
if democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has decreased by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate stands out to be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some key features among voters in the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multi@@ tudes consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external minister , most of the Democratic voters of the previous elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in all .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was split in March shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters across the country also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp however get good notes in leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off at hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nation@@ ally in large numbers . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also indicated that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes tur@@ f among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in poll@@ s - with 19 % support with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side guards for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values can only be measured in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood Associ@@ ated with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a chic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood took a brutal attack on Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which led to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to move across a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and claimed one hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said polic@@ eman Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and princip@@ ally set the welfare of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police officer Wagner .
he could not be resur@@ rec@@ ted , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly added injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with bl@@ unt strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ane of the Brotherhood . at least one student died since 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the first five members for the murder of the third Gra@@ des .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also take this to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the land@@ se will get into fu@@ elling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guidance on the process of exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so severely that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could see that all the excitement was over@@ done because of interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to decrease assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a later study on what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly up@@ trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis conducted by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Asset Management at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle and the return of return is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is highly remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the figures given by Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants all year round on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all development cycles from 1950 up to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and on pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put in the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market has anticipated an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the yields appear to change direction once the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond di@@ ps immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer relationship between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims to be a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio calendar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to change to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under another name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I think also really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the public as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted on the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; on a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future , or to spend money of fee tax@@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score ever since the record began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index for the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers ran around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought because of bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spending a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims who are buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are supported by Muslims at the first burial sites in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia sets down the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dis bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
gri@@ eving , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead oc@@ cured their last journey to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the sacred site , where only days ago a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the ends .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed down a sanc@@ tion over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 star@@ ters who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have had the arm of the crane to steal , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month , gathered .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials argue that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores that aim at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales offices will close nationwide
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its settle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their homes .
if you can use a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their houses , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including his management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her posted a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball Viz@@ em@@ eist@@ ers A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and acceptance .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of official abuse .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , had cryst@@ alli@@ sed that the accused were using funds from the association &apos;s accounts in 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial loss .
this fact divi@@ des the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity the defence argued that at no time an asset occurred to the association .
the sports officials only had hired allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - in 2001 , the liabilities were around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession large audi@@ tor of the financial department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ accused and co @-@ accused he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in taking into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of financial success , the withdrawal of the expense indem@@ ni@@ ties has been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore I paid out some of the expense charges only years later , namely since 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail revers@@ es seemed to be the case , the former ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and accounts managed by the two accused , said the second defend@@ ant .
why the out@@ flow of the association was not disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
the association was not interested in the details of the financial statement , it was important only the debt relief , the answer .
as in 2011 against the one of the function@@ ary investigations for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repar@@ ation report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why indem@@ ni@@ fication ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a law representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never taken a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to present accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer stored after a test in which everything was judged as correct , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the fixes have to be made in cash , and from his place of residence he must go to the bank to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reductions that have been running for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting .
the sub@@ missions of the U.S. computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of € 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share declined by 2.3 percent .
the company , which has become a large @-@ scale company in the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is now emerging : this means that the computer and print shop will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC shipments and a weaker demand from corporate customers to its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer was the last to last .
in the third quarter of the fiscal year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers came back by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
in this way , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive post@@ ings on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mostly be rep@@ udi@@ ated : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves agree .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
co @-@ operation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rests 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the trade fair focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility until September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility Connect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA car association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used tear gas and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundreds of displaced refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees burst through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a laun@@ cher ready .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially stopped pe@@ pper@@ spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now with@@ drew somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees sack in themselves and suffered from breath . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is watching when the US st@@ aves come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Senior Manager at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies letter
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 that said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who 19 is , and she was &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , as his life lau can be found on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug property .
all this certainly calls for his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and enhances Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future .
Euro@@ wings &apos;s low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been a complex company .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in a collective conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the court stopped on this Thursday .
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competi@@ tor routes , Lufthansa is presenting routes to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own cheap line .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this causes the left @-@ wing foreign minister to cry and to exclude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;

Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad hurt , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad with it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided that Dr. Se@@ uss was published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead gives a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it wasn &apos;t yet enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the curious , tree @-@ stri@@ cken , thin @-@ bloo@@ ded being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circular office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks section is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ e@@ ers are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th had been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully strikes more races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test person gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first started Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of man in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and receive four qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar An@@ s@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who lift up their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some smart additions to the Train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ine &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .

the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is running into a le@@ aching unit by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expressed ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises such as the EU is now and not always full of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually don &apos;t want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance sc@@ ram@@ ble at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European boy@@ friend , who wishes to look outside the Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a powerful force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not give helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ins@@ anity Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ countries most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas spread to diver@@ t him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door .
the press has never been able to do it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ he years , a bug back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most of the people outside U@@ ki@@ ps have traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ one tendency and the wild guer@@ ri@@ lla of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs had fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ial Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the Left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco remedy ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ lined the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ zeich@@ nen@@ rebu@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people per year die from a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ time , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ern@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least add your production to programs that others don &apos;t do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am obliged to see how this should be public @-@ law TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence is on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ er@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
in the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course you all think , we all think that for £ 150 per year we get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain themselves to the public broad@@ ca@@ ster TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound cards .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have to be heard with sounds that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by turning on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the de@@ eps brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noticed that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , found it out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain at a optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements to work and realize that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade plac@@ ards gre@@ ets the commu@@ ter in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works for free with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade - by creating the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , tw@@ o@@ fold company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains sti@@ cky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a stepping up of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are f@@ elling fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I retired as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ter 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ armed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the move into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to che@@ at : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you &apos;re in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you hon@@ estly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and that fire extingu@@ is@@ her would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverage recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and dress their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university on the pinn@@ acle of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked them something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to make a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb it belongs to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors whether it was a thing for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter because it was three in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with still lou@@ der music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse acci@@ dentally got into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future wife , to divor@@ ce her and see her again and see her every day and perhaps experience how she over@@ comes all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en to a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good pole is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never def@@ rost j@@ eman@@ ate room with too@@ th@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t pack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ person , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ger
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner is building in Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need cam@@ pers , but also the alone mother and the servant ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how you can build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed into the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a row house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in the blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .

Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford anything .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may be the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely by stream@@ lining the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a break@@ up of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; established three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to include chess players who cannot bring up the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office recently opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers receive information on questions such as health insurance or services of health and care insurance .
for years , we have been establishing an out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ tures relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not rarely a lot of benefits of insurance companies , because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ller and the citizen hospital as well as for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambul@@ ant service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the sal@@ ine was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training , or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the salon complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both business leaders in particular demographic change .
this creates a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the opening ceremony , dedic@@ ating himself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kg of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not intellec@@ tually agree .

in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says about the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
and one of these men cried out to the young men , and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sted and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh@@ s were checked by means of a stroke .
the wounded had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue work description is available .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police request witnesses and noti@@ fiers to register under the telephone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller to acquire Fel@@ ste@@ ausen practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the rooms at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms before years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently doing their professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to go into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss .
and so one agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to dwell in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work at the DR@@ K readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle themselves as hous@@ et@@ akers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and strain EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a total of 50@@ 000 euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that practice is being continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients enter the field of rock breaks in every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers will continue to look above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel gave a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly already sen@@ sed them after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum would also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is what this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister pointed out , Slovenia wants to limit its borders to refugees but not barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to pass by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was it to encourage people to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would expect .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the 500 @-@ kilometre @-@ distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said to us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , it could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ lying route for observation of already predicted displacement of the Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible delivery situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since gone through a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high refugee numbers at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the city and among people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
while some a pass@@ ant spontaneously attacks the chal@@ k and compl@@ ements the proposition to &quot; read my life , &quot; others can &quot; go with the camper through the United States , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long to suffer , &quot; others remain briefly , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again on the fr@@ inge there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make it clear to me that at some point the end comes to this world , I can live in a responsible manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian Plant of Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband is the bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective promotion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets , however , be understandable , after all it is a very personal matter .

F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a gain between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tions .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 US $ .
the lower prospect comes in spite of price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields sound yields , considering weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , about the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked for $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ sing shipments , which reported sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ ging sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in freight business .
in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the loan for the first time for almost a decade .
above them at the end of the adorned , two @-@ storey meeting hall , there is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Represent@@ atives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which im@@ poses itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance for an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far removed .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy sustain@@ s the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would re@@ assure the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued their currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would increase global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , whereas the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when the interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events had not occurred on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed became the world &apos;s currency authority .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow down her monetary expansion , caused del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als of the economy . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , approved member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for an increase in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aside aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is altered , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Nag@@ yk@@ öl@@ ked : hed@@ ged building site in the outskirts
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still enjoys teaching with her 74 songs .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school .
Rio Grande Brazilian Pap@@ al Society encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Organisation ( SP@@ RS ) is trying to inform women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried authorized the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be sh@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds step by step : in the recent council meeting , the extended construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the committee decided , among other things , an application for a structural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof over@@ lay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof area for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; this way we get together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect of the roof inclin@@ ation - although the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipality usually gets restric@@ tive when it comes to liber@@ ating applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the construction of gymn@@ as@@ tics it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude .
in the next step , the construction proposal for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Land@@ kreis district , which confirmed Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this , and the conven@@ ed Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further inside station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases at the inside station .
for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to agree on both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ele , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , contradic@@ ted rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ moving bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fishermen about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , I have not given them .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ ger with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police rus@@ hed .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young@@ sters were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old man from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , how prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police were hur@@ ried on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also captured on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be active and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home on the eve of a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquaintances , there was finally a suspici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the arrested admitted to the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward on Wednesday to the o@@ at fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put a charge on him .
a decision on the near@@ er circumstances of the action should carry out further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against lack of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing onto a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
that is why 14@@ 0,000 flats are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ class accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising tide of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also highlights significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit in front of it , which gets bigger from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0,000 living units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities , not@@ ated in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were reluc@@ tant to stay longer at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , the tax rate tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed flats may be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive fiscal amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding program for refugee accommodation at the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well @-@ known for cities and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia follow the corridor
after Hungary there is practically no going through , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces that leaving Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the depreci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have gone to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , are also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports were report@@ edly from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not encounter@@ ing border barriers .
for this the border crossing bears other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with small children and two older people are among the exhibitors .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage which tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier lat@@ tices were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the aim of this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government figures .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy on Sunday after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday , when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but because Germany had uns@@ ur@@ passed the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday for the refugee flow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Middle of Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously we have f@@ ished the un@@ hoped guests once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring it to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler at the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE train to a regional train in W@@ els in W@@ els on Sunday evening , after the short @-@ term announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try over the border .
however , the regional train was put off at the river Inn at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ brid@@ ged run spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent other tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis district of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans that are now confronted with chao@@ tic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ strong quart@@ ets
with the aid of refugees , Con@@ rad has all hands to do full .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to set up lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Convention Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad said and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad calculating with a demand of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ry year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has had discussions with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator will also put great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that arti@@ cho@@ don@@ ors have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad with his experience is based on the fact that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in placing it more successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the Republic as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
up to now , our own search for neighbour@@ hoods has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the moment no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to take these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the city boss critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has cor@@ ded further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continued departure of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria again introduces controls to its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the start S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million has been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on vene@@ er hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have their own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has got Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not answer the professional lady with the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag gets upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ up .
whether it mani@@ fests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , re@@ porters or reveals new knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cutting off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a word to many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wein@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was loud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold graves .
foundation of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home for a long time failed in the Bavarian State , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ orial History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explains for the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish , it is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; Die O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Grand@@ ma was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more distant to Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ anding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ inn@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm describes how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz bought something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they make it better if he doesn &apos;t win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinema @-@ singers , also in the USA w@@ akes up the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park was awarded the award for soft tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the evaluations for today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was included in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed not to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise has an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today &apos;s $ 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sunrise has been closed in recent months .
in August , Today , Today , Today it reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 ran .
until now , Sunrise has 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ age Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ age Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 recorded .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will finally prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery Un@@ v@@ eils ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , eventually landing at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have reli@@ ed on the ly@@ rical way that Wood is the perfect man and , in doing so , called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game &apos;s destro@@ yer who won the bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly recognised both themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noted S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose whom wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the lef@@ to@@ ver girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight as it did the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by league converter at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also to the running game after an injury to Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Elec@@ torate &apos;s Land@@ tag fraction conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
actually , entirely different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Security Z@@ ones for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we needed federal states &apos; standard standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s politics should not fall under the table in big wall@@ stadt .
a long lasting hand torch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started a pilot study &quot; intermediate level plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school was tested for three to four years .
but this is not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools who want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber boots on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to the rubber floor .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber boots used are known to be able to kill but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent conflicts since the age of 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been ruled over for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ator voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re @-@ built .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there is still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter property in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is called on the part of the city .
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
however , no contracts have been concluded .
the town Em@@ den had a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , bought a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning of the cottage settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , rig@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which pro@@ str@@ ated the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went to the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the estimated ten to twelve million euros have been in the discussion for months .
heavy reactions among sea land@@ lords who had come to the meeting cried out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Member of the sea and member of the board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a huge block overlooking all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that the transport through the intended size of the plant would greatly increase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus@@ ses must come for this to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the well a hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund to raise the $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escape from the war torn by the war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in humans who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c surgery - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabe@@ tic disease resolved completely and at 28 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , only one percent and some of them were only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also offered average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared with the Gast@@ rel@@ ap@@ ia Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity - about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people seriously to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is taking place at the moment in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot take all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and he added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to stop the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ orable , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence and that brought about unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of proceeds of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centers , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be hoo@@ ked up by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fragran@@ t hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold prescribed by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ur@@ ned her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and had stum@@ bled across her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities believe that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the New York State decided to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the tel@@ ev@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
during a rear @-@ end collision between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ mes a 33 @-@ year @-@ old mot@@ ori@@ sts were easily injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and was too late to keep two vehicles ahead at the roundabout .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audit and pushed this car to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident @-@ participating vehicles , property damage resulted from around 10,000 euros , the police report .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer available and had to be tow@@ ed .

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch tobacco leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights in the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they speak about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the ensu@@ ing withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by a 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now clearly stand at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to continue .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .

despite his comments just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he hur@@ ried back some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious with the signing of new appro@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target Mich@@ u with return reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , has indicated that he can withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pl@@ agu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and did not manage the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts auf S@@ FA @-@ Battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later aboli@@ shed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident happened in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to spin things - but it is said that the down@@ fall has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es rejo@@ ices to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league win that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or songs that haven &apos;t won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland was 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
since the security guards did not manage the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pe@@ pper@@ spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
one breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in custody first .
why I will witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January with his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and as many more applications are available as places , there will be a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery instead of deciding who will be elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he likes it and you get access .
I am compl@@ aining with her .
she admitted that she would have been able to form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after a wet police ch@@ ase , persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he was crossing the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to &quot; return gently to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace event incident in basin @-@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ in drove his car to the tren@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards have tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ff at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ drew 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point of view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching explained that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was the case yesterday .
but it also had so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described critics at Tac@@ kling his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favourites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm player &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark about the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him confidence because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is repeated over and over again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques all year round , but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this is repeated this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a but@@ t .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Game .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and there are no points of tension ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team was free on this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the final round in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 US $ deposit for drug delivery
a man who potentially threatened a life sentence due to his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a ref@@ und@@ able deposit of 200,000 US $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café might have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of criminal liability , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as a security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation represents a real financial burden of 200,000 dollars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stops at an initial lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : leader &apos;s house torn apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three participating trucks had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left , as the police rus@@ hed .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely demoli@@ shed .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping bun@@ ny .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed her mother instantly .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g said then to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work .
in this case H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ dges do@@ dge to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs left people with fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were transferred to the German side by foot over bridges and traffic jams .
there they are received from Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
after federal police data on Wednesday , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week .
around 700 people were arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 p.m. , said one speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm o@@ aks in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure in Western Europe , warm sea air is currently streaming into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the Trop@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom se@@ abed with arches from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun will look again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the cars at the IAA show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all a movement among the compact cars , which are currently very well selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registrations have ac@@ counted for this segment alone in August , according to the power @-@ drive Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not much more expensive .
Opel presents an introduction below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ ri@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ ri@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan driver wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a privilege to an ex @-@ prisoner of the justice @-@ law firm Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged in a cell that was too small for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation when they are accommodated in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to the information of his lawyer , is now on his free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy adhesion conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the constitutional judges raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for a renewed trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive for compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they said only in April a prisoner of indem@@ n@@ ity because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommodated between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours of aggression , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to bats , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Office of Justice , 21 agencies in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of up @-@ to @-@ date , 19 are expected to exp@@ ire in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to predic@@ tions by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to predic@@ tions by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has ever been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , however , is dramatic , especially in the case of affordable rental properties : each year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing fall out of the ten@@ ancy agreement , and to these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and Federal Minister of Economics agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ one , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of labour .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - mostly the viewpoint is enforced that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore , according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg for the integration of work .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zi@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries students without knowledge of the German language will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could become easier to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement of residence or debt do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law of asylum more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , the latter do not receive a b@@ af@@ e as they do not fall under the circle of the benef@@ ici@@ ary persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually replace Islam with the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church right to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights are also duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society will also need to change , reducing discrimination and racism .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act for a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ al show , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as anti @-@ racism convention Germany are committed must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees expected so far , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals equal to the registration of health cards .
provided services could be expected later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cast so many people with the restricted power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law enforcement law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers to create .
so far , the Berlin health schol@@ ar The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
but many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with the partially different diseases German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees possibly even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system ; several refugees are even doctors .
however , in order to be allowed to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ sed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer , among other things , to so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ break , and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent symptoms from chronic symptoms , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z said .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices of mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst takes hold of the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to day@@ dream in the man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift for am@@ ate@@ urs is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take people away from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ Cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cub@@ an duo wants to pick up easily .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer female hearts in a storm .
except through numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joint @-@ bli@@ ss .
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with their ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ mis@@ sal in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals is only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes of each wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ resting @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or a 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a statement by the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the transfer of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector based on the belief that tightly focused companies provide a better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ latest Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain at the European Championship .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then recovered to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; L@@ ess said .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to list most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate continues during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a prone period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; L@@ ess said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will pursue a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , counting 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; L@@ ess said .
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy show , giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever since , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stressed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with their emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more profound .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football watching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone counsel@@ ing told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come on with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest

di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who made the French champion the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only strive for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team who could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and past beautiful in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pp &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G himself sometimes got up with some f@@ laws and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone in no less than five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus scored his sixth consecutive year after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago in front of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who was playing for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , four times champion league winner , two times club world champion , twice world champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered user of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .

but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has won me with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , broke the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s victory .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she won &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ took to emphas@@ ise the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on affir@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown responded , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian encouraged themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producing colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove which is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against endor@@ sement of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide influence and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to enjo@@ in discrimin@@ atory practices against color content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums have still their meaning .
recently , leader of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crown first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who finished all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , up to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over the win of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful prize and life has changed , he gets the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth relay , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aking past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to write over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ es , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit hit since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better off at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear hit at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a Two @-@ Run to the right @-@ handed man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Mauer managed an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers scored in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not beat well , but he caught the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s rel@@ ap@@ se .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list for a shoulder ceremony , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the different thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup had passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controls Southern and Eastern borders
after Germany Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said it had already given the talks between the General Director for Public Security and Germany &apos;s representatives .
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann jointly requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet agreed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new imp@@ etus to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee trade in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , lam@@ ent this too .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can also not stay in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opinion was expressed in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 miles long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania had to be shut down with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers looking for alternative routes over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ chan@@ ger of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon is stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planet .
this di@@ ver movement is only small , but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it says in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it was long known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the south pole there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must now think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to demonstrate his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ in O@@ ko@@ tie will return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian National Player is to enter the running training .

despite the initial fears , he remained without a serious ble@@ ak .
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ go contains relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support the vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney adjust@@ s well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS will once again provide up to 9@@ 5,000 people for the Christmas business in the USA .

first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then marked cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blows partly with a storm force through the pedi@@ gree valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south@@ western flow .
on the alpine side of the Alps , on the night to Wednesday the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows in the F@@ öhn@@ t@@ valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in particular in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can pass through to the adjacent centre , and on the mountains are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday of stor@@ my hair for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture begins to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here rain set up that lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n exhau@@ sts the air , as a result rolls a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ proof rainf@@ all from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind pi@@ cks up strong up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
on Wednesday a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um in the middle of the old Rome .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a mad@@ man .
his negative impressions are likely to have confirmed him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then had initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment of the evening .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilt ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ old Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective themes , this may seem quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for around three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
in doing so , he has been fascinated by several partners : this applies to Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current contexts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts about the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lor@@ ds Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to work with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to make art more important in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious subjects that were important to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from the Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opening in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated to model the earth hill for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail it was finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration were responsible for off@@ ences , especially in the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first joint officer Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now was able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still happening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break @-@ break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga starts a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial course has to make policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ id@@ sbach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal officials also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they take the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sport@@ manager Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees goes to everyone , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our strength , influence , and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the Euro Quali@@ fication Play against Hungary this Friday the Women &apos;s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ sbach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their places had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : Chairman of the Executive Board loses sight of an accident in accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he held in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then went out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of labour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue with the software companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you fall down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Spar@@ pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mis@@ h ...

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco Re@@ us in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high intensity of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem eleven on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of root @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ k@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether wil@@ lows in the future are used in all Europe @-@ League games , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ego@@ ing statement by Mit@@ acher Re@@ us , that the final turn for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Middle @-@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l considers : &quot; with this Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic au@@ tos : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the autom@@ at IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Federal Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and a rapid rise in digital radio communication .
to test new technology there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not create additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which hitherto only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , vehicle @-@ free vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA presented by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the exam@@ in@@ isation Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the digital composite Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
well , every fourth would not leave the car under control under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf plans to open only in singles after current stand@@ ings at the title fight between 25 September and 4 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was on the flight at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship session in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also ste@@ als and we are European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with it he was hiding men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his attitude to a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ st the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers ta@@ sted 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender , fashionable steps of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion myself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ vers .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the pl@@ um lace fashion plays a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialist stores and also wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk goods are produced in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
exports are also weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the sti@@ cker in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year , we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outer office of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rev@@ amped the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine sel@@ ects small glob@@ ules at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ ly Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ß was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t do anything beforehand with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ dry lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
you don &apos;t want to touch legends , but Disney is still dar@@ ing to make a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays for 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director has already said : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI urged to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must be wide open out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should advoc@@ ate to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legal business environment assured and open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also impose controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thereby exploit the consumers a much higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks and s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ gram mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ or fish are already so strong with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already meet the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in case of cl@@ oning is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant defl@@ ection manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is heavily enriched by the food chain in predat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause especially un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury passes through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry for the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , e.g. in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide exceeded , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted in March from the paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most common reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
