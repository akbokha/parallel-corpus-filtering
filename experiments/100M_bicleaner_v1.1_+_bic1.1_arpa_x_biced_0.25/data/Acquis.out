the security measures according to this Convention will be termin@@ ated with regard to nuclear material when the community and the organization find that the material has been depl@@ eted or dil@@ uted in such a way that it is no longer usable or virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able for a nuclear activity which is under the point of view of the security measures of Bel@@ ang .
in accordance with this Convention , the Community veri@@ fies the transfer of core material from the States , which is subject to the safegu@@ ards according to the Convention .
the security measures according to this Convention will be termin@@ ated with regard to the core material as soon as the recipient state , as stipul@@ ated in this Convention , has taken responsibility for this .
the organisation carries out documents , from which any passing on and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures on the given core material .
if core material , which is subject to safegu@@ ards according to this agreement , is used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the community has agreed to the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated according to this agreement in relation to this material .
II ) that the Ker@@ material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives in the course of the non @-@ application of the safety measures according to this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision that the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used in such activity .
as far as possible in the provision , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied .
in any case , the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held over the total amount and the composition of the material in question or the concerned States , and any passing on such material from this state or states on the current state .
this explains its approval as soon as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval of the military activity and does not refer to the subsequent use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the execution of their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or individuals subject to their sovereign power , however , extraordinary costs are incurred as a result of a special inquiry of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs if it has been declared beforehand .
in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sample frames required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the states ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , applies to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as the citizens of the states .
any claim that the community or state is asser@@ ted against the organization or the organization in relation to the organization or a state because of damage - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - is governed in accordance with international law .
after veri@@ fying the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council will not be able to verify that no core material , which has to be subject to this Convention , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives , can refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ ute and , if necessary , take the measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied security measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of any dispute referred to in Article 19 or by the Council adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be attached to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbit@@ rators at the request of a party .
the community and the states ap@@ point two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four designated refer@@ ees elect a fifth that leads the presi@@ dency .
if the community and the states or the organization have not appointed two arbit@@ rators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the community or organization may seek to ap@@ point the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point this arbit@@ er .
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ er the fifth arbit@@ er has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on safety measures .
the aim of the measures laid down in this agreement is the timely detection of the separation of significant quantities of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a separation by the risk of premature detection .
in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the follow @-@ up checks by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity which is not assigned for a certain period of time is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
when performing their follow @-@ up examinations , the organization takes full use of the community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material community according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the community will use de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as it is necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of obtained , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures to evaluate accumulation of un@@ measured assets and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) Pre@@ ferences which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or is introduced into the states at a later stage of the core fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this convention .
a ) The provisions specified in this Convention will be termin@@ ated under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of the core material , which is subject to this agreement , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community about the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be termin@@ ated under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this Convention :
a ) special cle@@ av@@ age material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es its core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to the Convention , from these securing measures , provided that the total amount of material delivered in the states in the states is at no time longer than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ figure square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if released core material is to be processed , processed or stored along with the core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures according to this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the Community meets with the organization supplementary agreements required in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective consideration of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or altered without amend@@ ment of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , the organization provides a consolidated index of the total , the securing measures of this agreement under the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their follow @-@ up tests .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; special transaction &quot; which member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is governed by the organization as ste@@ wards and used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ effective debit notes of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the transaction account and to be deposited in the back@@ yard of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every member state may be able to make payments in front of the aforementioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate draws on the cash or the school j@@ ars in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
under the granting of these loans , the administrator shall be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral salary ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which is considered to be taken into account for the purpose of the pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement , called b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble .
the funds of the transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound for a programme or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , they are re@@ pay@@ able in 50 years each year .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
payments in order to pay this charge are to be made directly to the organization that it retains .
every transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
revenues from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the benef@@ ici@@ ary or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan granted , may be recipients of a special transaction loan .
re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the ste@@ ward to the Member State as soon as possible , as soon as possible .
the administrator will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC to complete all of the special transaction loans by the directors in preparation and through the projects and programs approved by the directors .
during the period of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator instructed the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator shall report the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC tran@@ sm@@ its as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , resulting from the accounts to be financed from the accounts pay@@ able to the account , and the withdraw@@ als made to the member states .
the E@@ EC and the Administrator are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the transaction accounts from time to time , lead to an exchange of ideas about the state of the transaction , the progress of programmes financed by special actions or projects and all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the E@@ EC and the Organization may not have entered into force , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all special transaction loans taken back by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States are notified of the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement will take effect and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the stated noti@@ fications for the organization .

in order to simplify the procedure for custom@@ izing customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes in the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , the agreement also appears to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force January 1 , 1978 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make a corresponding application .
the agreements may be concluded by the credi@@ tor &apos;s total amount to the mechanism paid by the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all member countries &apos;s future delivery funds .
already , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having to exceed five years altogether .
at the opening of the loans as well as their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw would not be made before the exp@@ iry of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be dealt with taking account of the funds of the bank , expected to be three or six months .
conditions would correspond to those who applied the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the required funds itself on the market , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Libor generated by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I encourage you to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are merged as follows :
- fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure a faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount specified in fact does not exceed the agreed quantity and will be executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to as Number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the Argent@@ ine@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion to imports of products recorded by this agreement on a ho@@ ech@@ st of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
at the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trading with each new Member State .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account for the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in the number 5 .
the total quantity known as number 2 is determined with the day of the Greek accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat on the joint market within agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community meets provisions to prevent the sale of broken meat from frozen meat as a result of the regulation of the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made subject to the origin in Argentina on the submission of an export license which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a b@@ ail for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the products in question .
in implementing provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the community shares in regular intervals the amounts given for export lic@@ ences ; these details may , if necessary , en@@ code to the destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not named collective numbers after the commun@@ ion .
the Committee shall discuss all the questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount specified in number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the quantity , which comes from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year , is set in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal nature of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with you the consent of your government .
I honour myself to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are merged as follows :

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful to them if you would share the approval of your government for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor you to share with you the consent of my government with the content of your writing .
with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I honour myself to refer to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organization for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat related .
recognizing the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb remain exist@@ ential after the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will ensure access to the market of the community at the agreed level .
new Zealand preserves the assurance that the normal paragraph of its hammer - and lamb &apos;s meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the amount invested in fact does not exceed the stipul@@ ated amount .
the stipul@@ ated quantities are executed in the traditional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand cannot be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community market .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties refer to each other prior to the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned above to find an appropriate solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it is committed to protecting New Zealand &apos;s interests resulting from this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed amounts , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion to imports of products recorded by this agreement on a ho@@ ech@@ st of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts set in clause 2 corresponding to the extent of New Zealand trading with each new Member State .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account for the ho@@ ech@@ est rate of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in Clau@@ se 5 .
the total amount stated in clause 2 is set at 2@@ 45 500 tons of car@@ c@@ ass with the day of the Greek accession to the Community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat on the joint market within agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of stock of intervention on frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the regulation of this objective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the two parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ el@@ sch in the community without danger to market stability .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ stlich der Uruguay about trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are merged as follows :
- fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Uruguay ple@@ dges to ensure that the quantity agreed in the actual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and will be executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to as Number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it is obliged to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay are exceeding the agreed amounts in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount set under number 2 according to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account for the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in the number 5 .
the total quantity known as number 2 is set to 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass with the day of the Greek accession to the community .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that might imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat on the joint market within agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of stock of intervention on frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sale of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made subject to the origin in Uruguay by the submission of an export license which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the responsible Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community shares in regular intervals the amounts given for export lic@@ ences ; these details may , if necessary , en@@ code to the destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Ö@@ stlich des Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before the 1st April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the consolidation of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are merged as follows :
- For@@ ged h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
in order to ensure a faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Uruguay comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount specified in fact does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account for the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in the number 5 .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular thanks to the fact that , within the quantities specified in this agreement , export licenses for the products listed under number 1 are granted .

binding wor@@ ding This Protocol , whose English , French and Russian wor@@ ding is equally authentic , is deposited with the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations .
prior to shipment , containers and in@@ fusion equipment must be provided with a label set in English and French , corresponding to the pattern contained in the proceedings 2 to 10 of this protocol .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred can only be sent in containers where the temperature can be kept at 4 C to 6 C during transport .
the preparations and devices mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and non @-@ toxic .
it is recommended to add the consi@@ gn@@ ments to the equipment required for in@@ fusion as well as the sol@@ vents for dry preparations .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is taken from a healthy human being and mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
C ) which are not free of diseases trans@@ missible by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
the blood sample is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ de through a closed , sterile tube system into a sterile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ elled before sterili@@ zing .
after the blood is stopped , the bottle is immediately closed and cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not drop 97 g per litre .
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system has to be determined by the blood cells and the serum ; determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
if there are standardized or recommended methods for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable .
the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific studies have yiel@@ ded the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E .
the blood being exchanged after this agreement should only be used for the recipients of the appropriate AB @-@ 0 group .
the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is in sterile , closed bottle protected from micro @-@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the time necessary for testing and transport , which may be at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood is immediately to cool down to 4 to 6 C .
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been gained ; other blood cells may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution , which was added after removal of the plasma .
the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is to be stated on the label .
all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the fu@@ gation must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure .
if an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , its volume and composition must also be stated on the label .
the human dry plasma is extracted through drying of the liquid that is deposited at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ ge or sedi@@ ment of the human full @-@ blood .
the human dry plasma is obtained through cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that occurs in the production of the substance .
the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations , in which ( using a fresh serum sample ) have been found to be a dangerous content of in@@ soles or immune sy@@ co@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ins are to be excluded .
if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood sample , the steri@@ lity of each unit in a blood volume of at least 10 ml must be detected .
in order to eliminate the harmful effects of the bacteria growth products in plasma , blood donations that show bacteria contamination are not used ; the steri@@ lity of every donation must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml .
in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cular hepatitis , it is possible to take mix@@ tures that do not contain more than 12 donations or use other methods that would otherwise reduce this risk in a similar way .
the amount of liquid that occurs in the production of the plasma is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved in 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced by it ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
II ) If one uses 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , cl@@ ot@@ ting occurs ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C .
due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0.@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss of more than 0.5 % may not occur in human dry plasma .
human dry plasma is stored in a container atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed bottle , under exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and the possibility of any moisture to be stored ; it is to be protected from light and kept at a temperature below 20 C .
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are preparations of the protein component , comprising about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma of the human full @-@ blood .
regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , after adding a suitable stabili@@ zer in the liquid state , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C for 10 hours to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the I@@ no@@ cular hepatitis .
in preparations made from human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in .
in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immuno@@ glob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present .
if the final product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product .
if the fraction is made of human plasma rot@@ ein as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of between 45 and 50 g per litre .
if a human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre .
comparison measurements of vis@@ cos@@ ity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the Ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are made before and after heating in the solutions , may not reveal any signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins .
after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ stage shaking in a mechanical shaking unit at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles .
I ) The for@@ gery tests with specific anti@@ sera must show that only human plasma proteins are contained in both preparations ;
( II ) The electro@@ phor@@ esis presented by floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions must show that the protein fraction , which possesses the mobility of the alb@@ um@@ component of the normal human plasma , amounts to at least 95 % in preparations made of human alb@@ um@@ in at least 85 % of the protein mass .
in other preparations made from human alb@@ um@@ in and in fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins , the sodium concentrations may not exceed 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l per litre of solution or recovered tro@@ k@@ screw preparation .
the potassium concentration of the fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins must not exceed 2 m@@ mo@@ l per litre of solution or recycled dry preparation .
after di@@ lution , the pH @-@ value of each preparation must amount to a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l potassium chlori@@ de per litre at a measurement temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.2 .
due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0.@@ 02 mm mercury , weight losses of more than 0.5 % may not occur in the dry preparations .
human dry alb@@ um@@ in is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an empty space in a sterile , closed container under exclusion of micro @-@ organisms and the possibility of moisture to store ; it is to be protected from light and kept at a temperature below 20 C .
solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are stored in sterile , sealed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms . they are to be protected from light and kept at a temperature of 4 to 6 C .
the label on the container contains all information registered on the corresponding Mu@@ Stere@@ tik@@ ett ( Anne@@ x 4 ) .
the normal human immuno@@ glob@@ ulin is a preparation made of plasma proteins , which was made from human , the antibodies of normal adults containing whole blood .
the method used must ensure that the final product fu@@ eled the further described conditions and does not transfer I@@ no@@ cular hepatitis .
in addition , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the starting product are concentrated in sufficient quantities .
the method is satisfactory for each final product in this regard , when in the initial and final product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ lled .
during manufacture , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance must be added ; in order to ensure bacterial steri@@ lity and stability of the final product , a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ zer can be added to it .
the final product is delivered as a solution whose immuno@@ glob@@ ulin concentration must be between 100 and 170 g per litre .
II ) The electro@@ phor@@ esis , represented by floating particles under acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein deposits possess the agi@@ lity of the gam@@ ma@@ components of the glob@@ ul@@ ins of the normal human plasma .
the final solution must not show visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ ding either before or after a 7 @-@ day heating . furthermore , it is advisable .

the ti@@ ter is measured by always re@@ di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be studied on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of blood circulation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ consistent anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te coating .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or National Nor@@ mal Prepar@@ ation in International Units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ idi@@ zed form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the shelf @-@ life tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , no matter whether in fluid form or after dissolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .

the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents to determine the blood group appointment .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are to be stored for so long from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents do not contain substances of human origin .
every single container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
