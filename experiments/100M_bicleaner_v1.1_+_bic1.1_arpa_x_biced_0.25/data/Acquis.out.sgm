<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62, the organization provides a consolidated index of the total, the securing measures of this agreement under the states, irrespective of its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their follow-up tests.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the EEC organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "special transaction" which member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement; this account is governed by the organization as stewards and used (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment takes place in the form of cash or ineffective debit notes of the member state, which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the transaction account and to be deposited in the backyard of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments, and the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date agreed between the EEC and the caretaker taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Every member state may be able to make payments in front of the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportionate draws on the cash or the school jars in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">Under the granting of these loans, the administrator shall be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Any special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project (including a sectoral salary), regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices, which is considered to be taken into account for the purpose of the preamble for this agreement, called b) of the preamble.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound for a programme or project within the framework of a loan or loan, which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization; thus, they are repayable in 50 years each year.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Payments in order to pay this charge are to be made directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Every transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Revenues from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiary or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has set at the time of loan granted, may be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Repayments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the steward to the Member State as soon as possible, as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator will instruct the EEC to complete all of the special transaction loans by the directors in preparation and through the projects and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of withdrawal of the special transaction loan, the administrator instructed the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator shall report the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC transmits as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, resulting from the accounts to be financed from the accounts payable to the account, and the withdrawals made to the member states.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the Administrator are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full issue of the transaction accounts from time to time, lead to an exchange of ideas about the state of the transaction, the progress of programmes financed by special actions or projects and all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the EEC and the Organization may not have entered into force, the agreement and all obligations arising therefrom shall be due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount of all special transaction loans taken back by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
