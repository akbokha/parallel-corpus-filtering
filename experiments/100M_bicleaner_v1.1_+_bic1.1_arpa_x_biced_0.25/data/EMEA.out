this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. unt@@ angle thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ take ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for taking or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are removed as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears mainly as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less degree than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol for twelve weeks , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ ing ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled ) , se@@ dation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for placing A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with A@@ bili@@ fy should be considered , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate an M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dos@@ ages , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central active drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor ) met@@ aboli@@ sm , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metaboli@@ tes .
considering the common application of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should predomin@@ ate for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
because of the lack of data on the safety of humans and the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to those treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of use in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma fever binding .
it is presum@@ ed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ pes .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ oper@@ atively controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients adher@@ ed to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sets scale , showed significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dos@@ ages with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or Hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior results in the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average el@@ ong@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l with extensive metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a non @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant differences concerning eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans so that they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal @-@ loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ carcin@@ oma and combined adren@@ al @-@ adren@@ al aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( which is 10 times the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the mid @-@ 3 and 11 @-@ times the medium @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dos@@ ages with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as a solution to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x aver@@ aging of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and to minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .

clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ative was greater compared to that of the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects were used intra@@ muscular ( 15 mg dose ) and received intra@@ muscular surgery at the same time as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) .
105 The H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &quot; ) metaboli@@ tes , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .

107 . the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of the agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for Plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ oper@@ atively controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients adher@@ ed to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ spiel@@ scale , showed significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction of the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior results in the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection than tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 to 5 times higher than the maximum human exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application there were no safety concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal @-@ loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication contained in a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
if only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference in drug efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ ols in the blood before starting treatment .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , and that unlike other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs , it was not necessary to use other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose in subsequent series should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were conducted and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ based nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel once again .
patients should not resume further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the number of neut@@ ro@@ p numbers rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te numbers is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected , cardiac events in the indicated patient collective are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to not have a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised to treat a sperm count prior to the treatment , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the mu@@ ti@@ lation and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estim@@ ations of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an optimized mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the inter@@ lac@@ ing of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ ses mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in communic@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous un@@ published trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given a dose of 175 mg / m2 in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy towards the decay of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical studies .
the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular distribution and / or crossover frequency of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared to an IV @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the clearance of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data were available for patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane water bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the craw@@ ler bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until complete res@@ us@@ board of the powder is done .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood conduc@@ tivity , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be performed under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medical drug when administered as an injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of stre@@ amed stre@@ amed under the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the drug has demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the Company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medic@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .

the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures requiring large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed via or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ arity , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose , which is required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with IV application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ arity , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose , which is required for controlling an@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l against the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of verti@@ ces by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an approach to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 @-@ 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive twice a week in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be initiated as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who suffer from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in patients who are fores@@ een for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or basic diseases : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ sen@@ sed PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the nutritional value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te is degra@@ ded , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if there is no other reason for a loss of action , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be weighed for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ state induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 Pati@@ ents with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ sed coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumour patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients may need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the h@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ ing adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction using the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are fores@@ een for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can not be excluded in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
on th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ a@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ l and , in respect of amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate , is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of local patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ es ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast cancer , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumors , and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis .
survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated with an@@ a@@ emia consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in controls because of various common malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and in controls satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than the serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 in animal experimental studies with approximate 20 times the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced financial body weight , dela@@ ying the oscill@@ ation and an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the relevant authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorization has to supply medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Training brochure : summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contributions .
the owner of the marketing authorisation has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1 is set up and functioning before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine applied in the traffic is applied .
the holder of approval for placing on the market agrees to carry out the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance as defined in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as any subsequent Risk Management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Human Use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information , the impact on current safety specifications , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction , within 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) mile@@ stones • after request by the E@@ MEA
• Have a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • If you suffer from unstable Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) , for example , if such a blood cl@@ ots have occurred in the past .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or of the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can come within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is reg@@ ressed during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , loss of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated prior to the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
rare has been reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ em ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will break off your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection to a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising levels of potassium , your doctor may take into consideration an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs with insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your readings of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed works like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is about to occur , Ab@@ se@@ amed should examine the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the treatment starts and be treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will possibly order certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatments .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Parti@@ cular caution when applying se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can go hand in hand with an increased risk of blood sample after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years was reduced by 70 % compared to those under placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to te@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ x are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non smoking and a healthy diet .
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an IV in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease .
following treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents from Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data on safety and efficacy is missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ emia can be treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of te@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics on bone structure a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , which occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients need@@ ing dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of cases reported as serious adverse effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney Dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which were associated as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the placebo and placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently frac@@ tured hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported on local responses to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area of a patient with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ ine h@@ al ≤ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ed@@ dy body frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric flow frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.3 % , the lower leg by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es was taken out of the basin comb .
in comparison with placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ row marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ alities were 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo @-@ treatment increased the BM@@ D at all time points .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study was random@@ ized to 50@@ 8 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in the case of Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.7 x 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording to the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 patients with ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients taking part in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long el@@ aboration phase with a terminal elimination of an el@@ min@@ atory period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent quick resor@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion across the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearing is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because te@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al mal@@ function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics .
for serious kidney dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with IV application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in rats was determined by administ@@ ering doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure referred to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was found at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum @-@ calcium levels .

July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described Pharmac@@ co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system in force and works before and while the product is marketed .
Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of authorisation for placing on the market is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities on pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance , which are presented in the Pharmac@@ co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get disease .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , the bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by re @-@ norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to kidney the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you should be concerned that you have sufficient liquid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium levels in your blood in time after in@@ fusion are not too low .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termin@@ ating the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at the moment it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have obtained Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium levels in the blood , such as cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently sli@@ dden low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of te@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics on bone structure a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive means of setting the smoking compared to a placebo .
on the other hand , studies on the placement of the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what is the risk associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? the most common A@@ compli@@ a side effects reported during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , they also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported by up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close persons must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can be used in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic resin and insulin can be retained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic resin and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ ate to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ onic resin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who additionally took insulin included reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately set with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma if pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone may not be used .
if AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , over@@ stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is continued should be conducted by the clinical assessment up to the date of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the central hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) was performed under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market introduction , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ genes , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , was reported with a decrease in visual acuity in diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on impaired vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on
calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or enters it , the treatment is abor@@ ted ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
this is due to the fact that , under the treatment of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , the hyper@@ insulin emia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the por@@ cine and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents beyond thre@@ ef@@ old the upper limit of the norm range often appear as compared to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure in pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency has rarely been reported under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and over 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study period over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone seems to have an activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( PA@@ R @-@ γ ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and improves the peripheral glucose classification in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequately set with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those patients who continued to receive insulin ; reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of Type 2 diabe@@ tics in a small study of 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced the total plasma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the nit@@ rate tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels of the post@@ erior pole , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively lab@@ elled pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the resin ( 45 % ) .
average plasma @-@ elimination of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metaboli@@ te is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , the elevated insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole @-@ indications led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tumors .

calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
in a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each of the pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both via an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ alities , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be taken from the package supplement ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes have out@@ weighed the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company to permit the transfer of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane to the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensive insulin therapy , for example , can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in patients , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
the doctor therefore has to consider possible interactions with the therapy and his patients always ask for other medications taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have bun@@ ni@@ es , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

the push button moves outside while you rotate the connection cap • The scale below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check a set dose • Note the number on the cap right next to the dosing list • Apply the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap simply forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
otherwise , insulin will be dischar@@ ged from the injection needle and the inserted dose will not be correct . if you have mistakenly deleted a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps :
then remove the cap and put it in such a way that the 0 of the met@@ ering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the button only during the injection . • Hold down the button after injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .

acet@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ate may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company to appro@@ ve the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin produced .
3 . when changing to acet@@ ate in the patient a dose adjustment is required , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have bun@@ ni@@ es , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non@@ diabe@@ tic patients ( blood sugar 4.@@ 4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( ages 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : • If you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin , if you eat too little or have a meal , if you are more than otherwise physically demanding
always set the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ let Ready @-@ pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the protective bottle from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Take the injection needle straight and firm to acet@@ ate Nov@@ o@@ let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • P@@ ull the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep up Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle up • knock a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , these will accumulate in the cartridge • While you continue to hold the injection needle upward , turn the cartridge around one click into the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • While the injection needle continues pointing upwards , press the button completely inside ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , the tip of the injection needle must secre@@ te a drop of insulin .
• Pu@@ t the cap back to the ready pen again so that the digit is 0 compared to the met@@ ering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the button is fully pressed .
if the button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle . the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outside while you rotate the connection cap • The scale below the button ( press scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Note the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap simply forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is down and you can feel a resistance . then take off the cap and put it in such a way that the 0 of the met@@ ering mark is opposite .
take care not to press the button during the injection , press the button after injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it is possibly in@@ accurate • You can &apos;t set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual scale to estimate how much insulin is left but you can &apos;t use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or pla@@ stering ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ ate deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment there may still be dr@@ y@@ attacks , and it is recommended that patients continue to use other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study where 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems only received 100 mg a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / d@@ l. in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received a dose of 80 mg once a day and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily took 120 mg of urine in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver function .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also contain a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ at@@ deposits ( including a g@@ out of disease known or currently available in the medical history and / or rheum@@ atism ) .
if serum acid levels are still higher after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increases on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since organ transplan@@ ts have no experience in organ transplan@@ ts , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ astic medicines , acute rheum@@ atism may occur during the beginning of the treatment , because first ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ sed by lowering the serum acid levels .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease during phase 3 clinical trials showed slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function before the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ al treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was no interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250@@ mg 2 times a day with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at ( around 1 hour ) is delayed and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not include the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born child .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group was observed in the Pi@@ vot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at were listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials there were no heavy r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced as part of the reaction cas@@ cade Hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is an effective , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ escap@@ ement that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
Plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times a day ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um@@ res@@ ic acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ res@@ ic acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed a treatment against a g@@ elling ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ elling ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ ine , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg of 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in serum @-@ res@@ ic acid concentration was observed , as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ Mark@@ ed F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in urine was found as an un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as further unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as an un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as further unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g r / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 4.@@ 3 times the human exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering of the intake performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about the 13 @-@ fold of the human@@ istic exposure , did not reveal any ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed a treatment against a g@@ elling ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ elling ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer ( lar@@ ges@@ ia ) , di@@ gesti@@ ble abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic bu@@ cks .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day of the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , should be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al structures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
this is why the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to take the medicine in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or a new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is important for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral drugs may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums rose to &lt; 8.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day were 8.@@ 8 % on the spine after 3 years , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo 6 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rates .
the two @-@ year extension of these studies continued to uph@@ old the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the whole body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Be@@ ated to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average or@@ ale bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses of between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours prior to taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 . studies of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily spread in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV application of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems .

in the liver , biot@@ rans@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ lic to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the presence of a radioactive marker vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , 4 days after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .
for this reason , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected in patients with reduced ren@@ al function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , and the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplantation were carried out and investigated how adv@@ ection is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the concur@@ rent medication needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ der@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under narrow @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level determin@@ ations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirrors should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 the systemic exposition , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clearing substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ ph can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral taking of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t receptor of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this switch in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) has to take place in relation to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation has to begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplan@@ t : an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day for adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ection in lung , p@@ ank@@ atic and color@@ ectal cancer , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ase transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosing adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function has no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine mean and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the blood level in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in the individual case using whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to carry frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirrors during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood vessels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ ing Adap@@ tation , Chan@@ ges of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent use of substances that might change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in blood 20 ng / ml are not exceeded .
in clinical practice , the blood vessels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection , or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ der@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under narrow @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs , no clinical data are available for the retard@@ ant formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data is available for the retard@@ ant formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the ing@@ es@@ tion of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was seen as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy called chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f has hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose free , special caution is required in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while using substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ness of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clear@@ ness of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients do not provide a clu@@ e that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposed a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effects on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ cal@@ emia ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly identified because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As are known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , patients with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ als ) .
cases of B@@ Cs @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ bic genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells , dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patient transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after intestinal transplantation as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published trials was consistent with the major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ein@@ gs syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ k et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) , the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % compared to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplantation @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( tre@@ ach@@ et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ at@@ - syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients receiving pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agent after color@@ ectal transplantation showed up to 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infection , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of di@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , and recently transplan@@ t ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ tied group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of Met@@ aboli@@ sm induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs through bile .
in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgery .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made otherwise so that the drug does not contain any proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate has been rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new bleeding episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for placing adv@@ ancements in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ tical events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not sink below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment process , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differentiate themselves in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ life times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a suitable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , with the greatest risk factor in the first 20 ex@@ positions and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurring of ( low @-@ ti@@ ghter ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
A@@ DR@@ s experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level occurred post @-@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE for 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed difficult to medium @-@ severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to trace of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other IV products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of the Factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical parameters deri@@ ve from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal to &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE safety profile , which requires a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extensions in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application to permit the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that bin@@ ds and supports other structures in the body ) is affected .
this is a type of virus genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; which has been modified so that there can be no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumour and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the sub@@ structure , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP insp@@ ected the company &apos;s responses to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the documents submitted at the beginning , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in brings benefits to patients in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumors .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passion @-@ Use &quot; programmes with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified ingredient release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the active ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may result in con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunt ) , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from con@@ ges@@ tive glaucoma ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to permit the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is generally swal@@ lowed ( i.e. without bit@@ ing or cr@@ ushing it ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time for long @-@ term use .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ ad@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva , which can be per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ ally as ab@@ h@@ ellen@@ ic rhin@@ o@@ carcin@@ oma ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data do not suff@@ ice to reach appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treating hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of headache ) must be stopped .
patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder retention or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their extent .
in the course of clinical examinations with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients irrespective of whether lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , showed no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ lement which can lead to impair@@ ment of mu@@ ti@@ lation or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ rous processes .
headache , anxiety , sle@@ ek mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin irritation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules p @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks related to flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine above the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n metaboli@@ zed badly .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to the administration of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ ra@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache , or a strengthening of existing headaches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
lubrication and operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage , it is not expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze as you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose on time , take it as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will adver@@ sely affect you or notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
in cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver function was also very rarely reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to take ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for taking .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup , respectively .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ri@@ dges , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all trials were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both trials at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ rel or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to permit the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet daily , with one or without a meal , for reli@@ eving the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been canc@@ eled and re @-@ recorded when re@@ occurring .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess which can lead to impair@@ ment of mu@@ ti@@ lation or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently encountered adverse events reported in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was headache , which was treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules p @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical study with multiple doses given in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( which nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective mal@@ function or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the various forms , is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
as hist@@ am@@ ines are an caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of the patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and being awake , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medicine is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) had no effect on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ rels .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

ap@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance levels ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption , or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( ages between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( ages between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children population .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 45 mg daily ( which nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor disorders .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not increase the alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this constra@@ ined metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those recommended by adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet should be removed without damaging them .
efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to the di@@ gni@@ fied wor@@ ding of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this badly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( A@@ wak@@ ening 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 m@@ g. of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined on pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ fin@@ tory studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

after the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) and rash .
A@@ eri@@ us solution for inclusion is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution to insert a application sy@@ ringe for preparations to be taken with sc@@ aling , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution for entering .
regarding treatment duration , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from and then determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rhea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia frequent side effects while in adults fatigue , mouth @-@ drying and headaches more often than with placebo were reported .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with child safe closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml @-@ cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from human to human because human beings do not yet have immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this strain .
subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the surface of the membrane , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of clinical data base did not suff@@ ice to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for prec@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you want more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
am@@ ate@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral medication the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , ap@@ ital@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
however , AIDS is not able to cure , but can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gen@@ ase was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to be prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the trials with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / m@@ L after 48 weeks than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few people responded to the treatment by the children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks as with the patients taking their previous release inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ chi@@ asis may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ chi@@ asis may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded just like a@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gen@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with k@@ night avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of permission for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing ads in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , am@@ per@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ital@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 . if A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the addition of the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Booster ) , higher doses of am@@ ate@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ital@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
am@@ ate@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of am@@ ate@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
normally , am@@ ate@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of am@@ ate@@ ase and k@@ night avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of am@@ ate@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should be monitored at O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if also low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r are given .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution for inclusion , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
am@@ ate@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the onset of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many patients had other diseases related to their therapy , which were associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) were reported .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude Ac@@ cor@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have often been observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already enters St John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s Wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rite avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study to be used in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ ci@@ d component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the recei@@ pts of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ night avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ night avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ins ) to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interactions when used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with a@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advised that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may cause resor@@ ption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous sei@@ zure with a@@ gen@@ ase can greatly increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days on subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to have marked increases in plasma levels while taking A@@ gener@@ a .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , a@@ gen@@ ase cannot be applied together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am , which is taken or@@ ally ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to be careful with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if also low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r are given .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dosage is adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ night avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as ap@@ ital@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful balancing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passed in humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the a@@ gener@@ ase @-@ treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ J@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not pre @-@ treated patients received 1200 mg of ap@@ ache twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception made increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were observed in patients who received a@@ gen@@ ase along with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures can be initiated .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of an un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ night avi@@ r @-@ dop@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 closed , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not show pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) on patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of the treatment and another against ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r ) , the in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early termination of a se@@ eding treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average variation in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ vacuum shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ brid@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , a generic solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose rite avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; am@@ ate@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children .
after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ tied am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate , must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , am@@ per@@ ase solution and ap@@ ital@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dys@@ functions is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were present in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the acceptance of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and for the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ations tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core testing of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of ap@@ ache nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposure that was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the addition of the addition of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of am@@ ate@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ital@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with low or minor liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function problems , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
am@@ ate@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rite avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ pen@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days on subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful balancing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , therapeutic optimization should be taken into consideration with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; am@@ ate@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ tied am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate , must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney dys@@ functions may be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were present in male animals , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

toxic@@ ity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in kit@@ tens the metaboli@@ tes are not yet fully mat@@ ured , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ alized solution for inclusion has not been proven with PI previously treated with PI previously treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , am@@ per@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ ital@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination with these patient groups is avoided .
although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col@@ m content , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of having HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
am@@ ate@@ ase should be stopped for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous sei@@ zure with a@@ gen@@ ase can greatly increase the plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution to the intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passed in humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced weight of 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ night avi@@ r @-@ dop@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ ate@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine was prescribed to you personally .
it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − When one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gen@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect of ap@@ ache .
the use of a@@ gen@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test conducted by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above diseases or take any of the above medications .
if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ gen@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure that you have carefully read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with k@@ night avi@@ r for ampli@@ fication of children aged 4 to 12 or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take A@@ chi@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional Factor VI@@ II to control the ti@@ lt . − For patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .
if you have certain medicines that can lead to serious side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor will perhaps perform additional blood tests to minimize potential safety issues .
it is recommended that HIV positive women should not satisfy their children under any circumstances in order to prevent HIV transmission .
traffic jams and the operation of machines No studies have been carried out to influence the efficiency or the ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you are suffering from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than an hour before or after regeneration , otherwise the effects of a@@ gen@@ ase can be reduced .
dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that the intake of k@@ night avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
if you take advantage of this as much as possible , it is very important that you take the full daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .
if you have taken a larger amount of ap@@ ache when you should have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ ache , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .
if you have forgotten the intake of am@@ ate@@ ase If you have forgotten the intake of am@@ ate@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking as before .
in the treatment of HIV infection it is not always possible to tell if any side effects are caused by A@@ gen@@ ase , by other drugs that are taken at the same time or caused by the HIV infection itself .

the frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week for six weeks with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . • For ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , it can be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected skin areas so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about 8 hours ) before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients receiving complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either carried up daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with placebo showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or accept@@ ability of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is to continue for a long time until all visible tendencies in the genital or per@@ enni@@ al area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examinations 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should begin ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the cleaned , infected skin area , until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a weighing in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with one for circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ tur .
for an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream at higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or resulted in temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external ti@@ lt war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ gola region has not yet been found in clinical experience .
although limited data points to an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or because of the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made from several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there is currently no data available about long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tumors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ic positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the efficacy of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study reveals that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be quanti@@ fied either after one time or after multiple topical application , no recommendation is given for use during the lac@@ tation period .
the most frequently shared and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the trials involving three weeks of treatment were local responses at the site of the treatment of ti@@ lt war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related adverse effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream are listed below .
the clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream often lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ting / sc@@ rap@@ ing up ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
according to the study plan , the clinical signs indicated that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often found severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and to severe de@@ formation and sti@@ cking ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies evaluating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was detected at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent , unique oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment was superior to over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all patients who were treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the cow@@ ards were completely cured ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five times per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discreet , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ comfortably scal@@ p or face .
one @-@ year data from two combined observations showed a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external incl@@ ine , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ otic and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies with the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis was observed in the three @-@ weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and num@@ bed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ ill skin of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ opla@@ sty or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen @-@ weight ; a study on der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with fin@@ ite administration in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the application point .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has little systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low as a result of systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study examined mainly the safety of the medicine , but its efficacy was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review and update any new information that may be disclosed .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will monitor patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in response to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV a permit for the placing of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ l @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial induction rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effects that occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience concerning the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after inter@@ ruption of the treatment has to be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk of over@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be weighed .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the preceding response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended that the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms is not sufficient .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions observed in the age of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older are often reported in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing @-@ still@@ s and face ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Re@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged less than 5 years , with predominantly severe sequ@@ ential form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment was started , with a more severe form of circulation in patients aged less than 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or until premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with which it had never been ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with low @-@ low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient accumulation of the enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of the patients were of the central phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma showed an improvement in lung function and the capacity of the patients treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically in@@ significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in view of the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe tra@@ verse form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the elderly patients with severe delay form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dosing schemes were carried out on G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fusion ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ as is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical profile in patients at age 5 was similar to those of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be bl@@ ended with other medicines except with the ones listed under 6 . 6 .

within the specified period , the holder of the marketing authorisation shall conclude the following program of study , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit / risk ratio .
this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ l @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which split certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicine containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of reduced al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
advice for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
the initial induction rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditioned involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing @-@ still@@ s and face @-@ ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • stomach pain • rash • Joint Diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ ressed • fever • ch@@ ills • increased pulse • hypertension
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available to evaluate each year , and if necessary , the package will be updated .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • determine the number of th@@ inner flas@@ ks to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
for patients whose hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of am@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin out@@ lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the same medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to permit the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
every penetration bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must undergo further treatment according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 doses or so@@ - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 , or over 65 years of age , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a function of liver function &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or tran@@ sam@@ ic as@@ en@@ ia of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology has again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was administered - if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ ec@@ tory before ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be weighed .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm count prior to the treatment .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 mg daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses when using normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes severe birth defects are expected for an application during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except if it is mandatory and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed exceeds mother &apos;s milk and un@@ desirable effects on breast@@ fed infants cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three individual p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead back to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could possibly be related to study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC , which random@@ ly received C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who random@@ ly received c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ ves@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ it@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically meaningful survival compared to those patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) associated with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ centre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was treated with medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival occurred in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.00@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination against gem@@ cit@@ abine and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total retention interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ suffici@@ ency limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin require less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the addition of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed after injection as a mono@@ therapeutic agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ions over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours after the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total zone of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , who received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , retinal changes were observed ( de@@ genetic aber@@ ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ um tissue ) .
if not used , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
dissolve the contents of the 100 mg reading bottles with a 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising product quality .
every penetration bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
23 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats that are fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 showed no significant weight loss for patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
the most common side effects of allergy ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco finish , chair , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , ab@@ duct of o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( fl@@ utes ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied to patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ tical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 as insufficient data is available for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to minimal resor@@ ption , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjustment of the dosage .
• C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if it is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated blood cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in multiple cases with concur@@ rent use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K , as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , the patient should be advised to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of reported adverse events detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to conver@@ sions with regard to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects that can be traced back to the li@@ pi@@ ous properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect takes place in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
derived from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , has blocked absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ tre@@ ph@@ ased diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients given the minim@@ ally system@@ ically absorbed dose , two main metaboli@@ tes , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ on@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not make any special danger to humans .

the most common side effects are combined with the action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Begin a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of losing your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Store the medicine for children in@@ accessible . • Do not store it after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two sealed tanks with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow it in any case . • You can take your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) which is enclosed by this pack .

alo@@ xi is used for chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate causes for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ struction or sign of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or those are prone to such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy regi@@ men , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for prevention or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single IV dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ate oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ o@@ tin , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tral@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events reported at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were reported ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least may have been associated with Alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
the group with the highest dose showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment for alo@@ e over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 750 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron given by day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the study with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV application follows a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours following an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional to the whole dose range of 0.8 - 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
following IV application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical simul@@ ations indicate that , once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days , the total text position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with that of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for the metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an IV single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a unique intraven@@ ous injection in healthy eyes , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elimination of the elimination corne@@ a and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects have been observed only by expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficiently above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance to clinical use .
10 of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of the action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion , in which the approval of approval for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme , al@@ anine am@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) , are abnormal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to stimulate the production of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , efficacy , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference resin by 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment responded to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
e @-@ mail : e @-@ mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
in addition , concerns have been raised that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease grew again in more patients than in the reference medical remedy ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine produces an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not vali@@ dated adequately .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by crust formation ) and small infected fir@@ mation ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or believed to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ drug @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not act against this type of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but under 18 years of age the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was gone after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation on the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections weigh over the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mation , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. for placing Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ments are carefully wi@@ ped out and an adequate alternative therapy of infection are started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ob@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected place occurs .
the impact of simultaneous use of retin@@ ob@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected in vi@@ vo due to the low plasma concentration that has been achieved in humans after topical application ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 At the same oral dosage of 2 times a day 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean retin@@ os@@ in@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when topical retin@@ os@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient with regard to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ob@@ in@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to admini@@ ster systemic antibiotics .
if the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy should be weighed for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections applied to al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported adverse effect was irritation of the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of con@@ rod mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly called Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50 @-@ sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding adjustment interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of retin@@ ob@@ ulin at least appear question@@ able at at least some forms of infection , consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ os@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ ization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan consisting of two doses can be put to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis C or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ inated vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but in the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses of tw@@ ins , tw@@ ins and tw@@ ins are administered .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation Plan for Grun@@ dim@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose being given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ co@@ ction is required for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully backed up whether immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need to have a re@@ fres@@ co@@ ction as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody are under certain conditions , so that the administration of further doses of vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in cases of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ int@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % of the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % of the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got the Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per rehear@@ sal , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in 28@@ 9 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose compound than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines obtained either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year coinci@@ ded with the fresh@@ ening of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us @-@ influenza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ en@@ dium by eye on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release will be carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory accredited to that purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus even if the full vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that harm the liver or cause symptoms similar to those associated with hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or the tongue . • If your child has already an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
if you are at a risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ inations , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dosage ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child take more medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been given immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ often ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Re@@ ver@@ aging • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
other adverse events reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 consumed cans ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has been known since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP points out that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ completely enzyme defects or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided up to several single doses of meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without substance ) .
it can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste conversion , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with the metabolism of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval there was only limited information about this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ onic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ oses if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also delayed stimulation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials involving AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients experienced at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal uter@@ ine patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an in@@ adver@@ tent dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ dictions of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ born infants were previously almost always infectious , and the disease itself was leading to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogy .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen de@@ position ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life @-@ month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the or@@ ni@@ cot@@ ine deficiency syndrome ) , who were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , mean the survival rate was 98 % .

phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were calculated using a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl acet@@ ate in plasma could be detected in the plasma after a different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) were five times higher than after the first gifts .
secre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans did not have any indic@@ ative effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat corne@@ as were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions were found in the brain cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal uter@@ ine patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen are produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients another worsen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of durability , the patient can only store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding time , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , sub@@ letting of ear , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood picture ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant smell of the skin , rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .

31 • Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended amount of measuring spoon gran@@ ulate out of the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress lifting &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in with sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ un@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who have undergone a PCI , angi@@ ox@@ in related to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of angi@@ ox@@ in across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is followed by a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours can be resum@@ ed according to clinical requirements .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg must be given immediately prior to the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately following IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole type of bolt of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us should be of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully bl@@ ended before applying , and the dose may be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second stud dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second stud dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox@@ is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
angi@@ ox treatment can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular heat .
• Un@@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other constitu@@ ent or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance in hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a per@@ kut@@ ane coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may undergo bleeding during the treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is again achieved before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , these agents can increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with plat@@ el@@ ets of plat@@ el@@ ets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
animal experiments are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional heat par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and the groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more common adverse events in women and patients over the age of 65 than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined following the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding , as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ dine plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of point , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge concentrations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point @-@ points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients who are PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organism classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately broken and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the an@@ ion retention region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is present in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part split the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with serum from patients with he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te @-@ ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was followed by a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or by PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients submitted within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple end points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) are shown in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine as pe@@ p@@ tide is a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metaboli@@ te resulting from the split@@ ting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the toxic@@ ity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to the 10 @-@ fold of the clinical Ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to exagger@@ ated pharmac@@ ological effects .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or to process insulin effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human @-@ normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ c@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to reduced heat @-@ ogen@@ esis and decreased insulin metabolism , the insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
the type of insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc lag , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change insulin demand .
3 A inadequate dose or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the course of conversion of the treatment scheme .
among the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ate , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotic .
in addition , under the influence of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tica such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c antagon@@ isms can be weakened or lacking .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is passed into human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are listed according to clinical trials which are known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and arranged according to decreasing incidence of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability of available data ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , resulting in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a properly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose up@@ take ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the efficacy of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin sensitivity increases faster and the duration of action is shorter than with the normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male subjects aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ lis@@ sin in the therapeutic relevant met@@ ering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ esis effect , and at 0.3 e / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like Human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ esis effect about 2 hours earlier than Human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a similar post @-@ den@@ oun@@ den@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ounced control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin by dosage 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal @-@ mal@@ ine , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
