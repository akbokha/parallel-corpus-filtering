<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. untangle thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal uptake) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for taking or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are removed as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole probably appears mainly as a" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol for twelve weeks, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhaling (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Loracepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), sedation (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for placing Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify should be considered, should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate an MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosages, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events involving Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central active drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor) metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should predominate for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate rise in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (omprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of the lack of data on the safety of humans and the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients with Aripiprazole treated lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to those treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and also in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripianzol, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is of use in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma fever binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is presumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTC receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1Recipes.</seg>
<seg id="76">A dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and the puttest showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operatively controlled trial, 52% of responder patients adhered to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assets scale, showed significantly greater improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosages with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed superior results in the prevention of a bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxycycline of Aripibrazl, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elongation period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= poor ') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences concerning ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans so that they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal-loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans) and an increase of adrenal cortex-carcinoma and combined adrenal-adrenal adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (which is 10 times the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulfate-conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazol, the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the mid-3 and 11-times the medium-steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used for rapid control of agility and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazl injections solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and to minimize variability, an injection in the deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injections in patients with agility and behavioural disorders that were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injections are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally associated with schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedative was greater compared to that of the sole administration of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects were used intramuscular (15 mg dose) and received intramuscular surgery at the same time as Lorazepam (2 mg dose).</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor ") metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Loracepam (2 mg dose) was intra-muscular, the intensity of the sedative was greater compared to that of the sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials involving Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107. the following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy, and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as agility and behavioural problems, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of the agility and behavioural problems compared to placebo and similar to the Loracepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for Placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operatively controlled trial, 52% of responder patients adhered to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-Depressionsspielscale, showed significantly greater improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction of the relapse rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed superior results in the prevention of a bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazl AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection than tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl injections was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 to 5 times higher than the maximum human exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application there were no safety concerns after maternal exposure, which lay in 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans; therefore, they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal-loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans) and an increase of adrenal-state carcinomas and combined adrenal-state adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10-times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Cholelithiasis as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81-fold the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study, involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication contained in a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference in drug efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may not be used in patients who have low neutrophilenzols in the blood before starting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The CHMP Committee on Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, it was not necessary to use other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilology &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy, the dose in subsequent series should be reduced to 220 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy Grade 3, the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2, and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is an Albumin-based nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel once again.</seg>
<seg id="283">Patients should not resume further Abraxane treatment cycles until the number of neutrop numbers rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thrombocyte numbers is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not detected, cardiac events in the indicated patient collective are not uncommon, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients after the treatment of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constiptive means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised to not have a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised to treat a sperm count prior to the treatment, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) which can affect the mutilation and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, obsophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscular weakness Very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimations of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an optimized microtubules active ingredient that promotes the interlacing of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of microtubules, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin communicates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminreceptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secretted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unanimous unpublished trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given a dose of 175 mg / m2 in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy towards the decay of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Exposure Exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous injection of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravasculular distribution and / or crossover frequency of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to an IV-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values of a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data were available for patients at the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetical analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be taken care of when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into an Abraxane water bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the crawler bottle should be swivelled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until complete resusboard of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If forgery or sinks are visible, the water bottle must be inverted again gently in order to achieve a complete resuspension prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called" "" "reference medicines" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood conductivity, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be performed under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it enables to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference medical drug when administered as an injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to seamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of streamed streamed under the skin with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The CHMP Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the drug has demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The Company that manufactures Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medicce Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG to approve the marketing of Abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures requiring large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Because of the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed via or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobularity, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permissible dose, which is required to control anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week with IV application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobularity, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permissible dose, which is required for controlling anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl against the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of the hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of vertices by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an approach to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33-39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, Abseamed should receive twice a week in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be initiated as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of the surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of the dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from the treatment with any erythropoetin on an erythroblastomy (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive seamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomy).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are foreseen for a greater elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or basic diseases: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an antisensed PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the nutritional value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte is degraded, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index"), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if there is no other reason for a loss of action, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be weighed for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of seamed in patients with a risk for an anti-state induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 Patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidensed coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are still not dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients under chemotherapy, epoetin alfa drugs should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and erythropoetin response (patients may need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapyrelated anemia - Dosing adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction using the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are foreseen for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated accordingly before the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a greater elective orthopaedic procedure should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombocytic and vascular diseases, especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can not be excluded in the treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be checked and the Ciclosporine dose should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">On thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, retinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycol and, in respect of amino acids and carbohydrate, is identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin isolated from the urine of local patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not influence leukopoesis.</seg>
<seg id="436">389 patients with hemoblastomes (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin- lymphomas and 24 other hemoblastoses) and 332 patients with solid tumours (172 breast cancer, 22 prostate carcinomas, 22 prostate carcinomas, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas, and 30 others).</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients with recombinant human erythropoetin treated with anaemia consistent, statistically significantly higher mortality than in controls because of various common malignancies.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thrombosis and associated complications with recombinant human erythropoetin patients and in controls satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumor patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa determinations after repeated IV application showed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, epoetin alfa serum levels are much lower than the serum levels obtained after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no cumulation: serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a well-known complication of chronic renal insufficiency in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study on hemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for three years, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your readings of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) and adjust your seamed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood clots (thrombotic event).</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (adipous) or if in the past already thrombotic vascular events occurred (e.g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are a cancer patient, remember that Abseamed works like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adversely affect the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If a larger orthopaedic surgery is about to occur, Abseamed should examine the cause of your anaemia before the treatment starts and be treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of red blood dye (haemoglobin) are too high, you should not receive seamed because there is an increased risk of blood clots after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your anemia (anaemia) responds to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including patients who recently suffered a low traumatic hip fracture; • Morbus Paget of bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of Paget, Aclasta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures was investigated over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood returned to normalized or at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of eddy fractures in patients under Aclasta (without osteoporosis) over a period of three years was reduced by 70% compared to those under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without osteoporosis) the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients with Aclasta had a fracture (92 from 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to teoledroneic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclax are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecrosis (dying of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta's manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta to treat osteoporosis, which contains indications of how to use the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited for the marketing of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The packaging supplement • contraindication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non smoking and a healthy diet.</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an IV infusion of 5 mg of aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the Aclasta infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget disease.</seg>
<seg id="592">Following treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily for at least 500 mg elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents from Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, since data on safety and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokaltsemia can be treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of teoledronics on bone structure a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, which occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily for at least 500 mg elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be considered before use of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental surgery, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of cases reported as serious adverse effects of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (1.3%) (51 of 3.862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney Dysfunction Zoledroneic was associated with kidney dysfunctions, which were associated as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually prior to administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical trial in osteoporosis over three years compared to the placebo and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinins within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently fractured hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledroneic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local responses to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates, including coledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients performed osteonekrose in the jaw area of a patient with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose that leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 to 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the femine hal ≤ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing eddy body fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric flow fractures Aclasta sensed significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of eddy fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density in the lumbar vertebra, hip and distal radius compared to the placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.3%, the lower leg by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In the case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies was taken out of the basin comb.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison with placebo, a microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone marrow marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was held at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not measured routinely, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortalities were 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo-treatment increased the BMD at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study was randomized to 508 men and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the yearly administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in the case of Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.7 x 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value when recording to the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledroneic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 patients with aclasta and the 107 patients taking part in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with aclasta could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledroneic acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulation system with half-life times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ -1,87 hours followed by a long elaboration phase with a terminal elimination of an elminatory period t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent quick resorption into the bones and excretion across the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearing is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because teoledroneic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Coledroneic acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal malfunction down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require coledronics.</seg>
<seg id="655">For serious kidney dysfunctions (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally-acting intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In trials with IV application, the renal tolerability of zoledroneic acid in rats was determined by administering doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure referred to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated exposures that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the Metaphysical of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogeneity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was found at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledroneic acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget disease.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially oestrogen formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget Morbus, the bone structure takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by re-normalizes the bone structure, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus reinforces the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied, even if it is non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to kidney the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin, it can be used in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest acceptable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonic resin and insulin can be retained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonic resin and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of acetate to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonic resin showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who additionally took insulin included reduced HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disorders, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoglycaemia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequately set with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema if pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overstomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone is continued should be conducted by the clinical assessment up to the date of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the central hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) was performed under the treatment with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market introduction, the treatment with thiazole indigenes, including pioglitazone, was reported with a decrease in visual acuity in diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report on impaired vision; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">Calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or enters it, the treatment is aborted (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under the treatment of pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin emia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the porcine and refractive index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents beyond threefold the upper limit of the norm range often appear as compared to placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure in pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, insufficiency has rarely been reported under Pioglitazon, but more often when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were performed in groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study period over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) activation of specific nuclear receptors (PAR-γ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and improves the peripheral glucose classification in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately set with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those patients who continued to receive insulin; reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decline in the albumin / creatinine quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of Type 2 diabetics in a small study of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasma-glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while under Metformin and Gliclazid reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the nitrate triglyceride levels but also improved the triglyceride levels of the posterior pole, both on the triglyceride level and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised to groups who received either Pioglitazon or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively labelled pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the resin (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">Average plasma-elimination of immutable pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincided after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazone, the elevated insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazole-indications led to increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">Calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each of the pioglitazone or Gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decline in the albumin / creatinine quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the intimidation triglyceride levels but also improved the postdendial increased triglyceride levels, both via an effect on the tryglyceride level and the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortalities, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study measured the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that the blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actrophane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be taken from the package supplement).</seg>
<seg id="869">The CHMP Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane in the treatment of diabetes have outweighed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the Novo Nordisk A / S company to permit the transfer of Actrophane to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensive insulin therapy, for example, can change hypoglycemia symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA towards insulin-animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actrophane in patients, it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplant, and the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplantation were carried out and investigated how advection is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and appropriate daily dosage; renderations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under narrow-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptations must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level determinations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus-level mirrors should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4 the systemic exposition, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a low clearing substance, an adjustment of the Advagraph can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection. oral Advagraph therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adaptations can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraph therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant receptor of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this switch in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg) has to take place in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressant drugs to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation has to begin for prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant: an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day for adult patients who are converted to Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advection in lung, pankatic and colorectal cancer, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in pankrease transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosing adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function has no influence on pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatine mean and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the blood level in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and tolerability in the individual case using whole blood-tacrolimus-tallow-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry frequent checks of the tacrolimus-level mirrors during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood vessels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraph, Dosing Adaptation, Changes of immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent use of substances that might change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in blood 20 ng / ml are not exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood vessels of Tacrolimus are usually in full blood in the first time after liver transplants in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection, or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and appropriate daily dosage; renderations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under narrow-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressive drugs, no clinical data are available for the retardant formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data is available for the retardant formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the ingestion of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be avoided (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, prograf was seen as a cardiomyopathy called chamber or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf has hard capsules, retarded, lactose free, special caution is required in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies, known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while using substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics like ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macroid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 Hemmer; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can impair their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearness of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is particularly cautious in decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearness of pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of tests on transplant patients do not provide a clue that, compared to other immunosuppressiva, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposed a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for any adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effects on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a newborn hypercalemia (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus cannot be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level should be mediated by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphobic genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells, dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published trials was consistent with the major studies in which prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplants for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi-center study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis oblitereings syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Trek et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Compared to 38.0% of Ciclosporin (p = 0.025), the patients treated with Tacrolimus were compared to 38.0% compared to Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the transplantation-transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (treachet al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterat- syndrome in the patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicentre study with oral prograf was carried out to 205 patients receiving pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised procedure Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressive agent after colorectal transplantation showed up to 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multiviszeral transplants) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the untied group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of Metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids shall be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion mainly occurs through bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraph (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is made otherwise so that the drug does not contain any proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was examined.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"" "in the main study, the efficacy of Advate has been rated" "" "excellent" "" "or" "" "good" "" "in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes." ""</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for placing advancements in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following heretical events, the factor VIII activity should not sink below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differentiate themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a suitable dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the greatest risk factor in the first 20 expositions and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestic inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurring of (low-tighter) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADRs experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients) who showed a higher risk of inhibitors of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-level occurred post-operatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the Plasma and the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials involving ADVATE for 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 expositions with ADVATE showed a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, a FVIII inhibitor was found in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed difficult to medium-severe hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study formed 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to trace of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that showed an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefit-risk assessment as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the ADVATE safety profile, which requires a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extensions in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resumes its application to permit the transfer of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that binds and supports other structures in the body) is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which has been modified so that there can be no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumour and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the substructure, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP inspected the company's responses to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the documents submitted at the beginning, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin brings benefits to patients in Li-Fraumeni tumors.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP about whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassion-Use" programmes with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified ingredient release" "" "means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the active ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may result in constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunt), mouth-drying, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic substances or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from congestive glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrophy) or stroke (cerebral haemorrhagic stroke) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to permit the marketing of Aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is generally swallowed (i.e. without biting or crushing it).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on the harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time for long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other decadjunctiva, which can be perorally or nasally as abhellenic rhinocarcinoma (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data do not suffice to reach appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treating hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headache) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertonia • patients with hypertonia • patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder retention or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to carrying out dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical examinations with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients irrespective of whether loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, showed no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizzlement which can lead to impairment of mutilation or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letturous processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, sleek miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, skin irritation, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules p-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rhinitis and 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined by the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine above the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin metabolized badly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was the exposure to the administration of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Lorraadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmacovigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, and its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur when using Aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart chasing, heart palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache, or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Lubrication and operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage, it is not expected that Aerinaze will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">In cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver function was also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate to take (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadridges, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all trials were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius increased by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both trials at Urticaria, the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, laurel or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to permit the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet daily, with one or without a meal, for relieving the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms have been canceled and re-recorded when reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drowsiness which can lead to impairment of mutilation or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently encountered adverse events reported in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headache, which was treated at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules p-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple doses given in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (which nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including amplification of subjective malfunction or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis, depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life of Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria was examined for further forms of Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of the various forms, is similar and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamines are an causative factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and being awake, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 medicine is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study involving desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) had no effect on the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with desloratadin and laureadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of desloratadin and laurels.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aperius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience higher substance levels (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges, which can easily spread from human to human because human beings do not yet have immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this strain.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane manure of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the surface of the membrane, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), was purified and used as a constituent of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution to take, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Amatease should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which antiviral medication the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, apitalase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">However, AIDS is not able to cure, but can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>

<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the trials with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / mL after 48 weeks than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but only very few people responded to the treatment by the children previously treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenase together with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks as with the patients taking their previous release inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Achiasis may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Achiasis may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines, which are degraded just like agenase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking Agenase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoneksis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amp Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agenase in combination with knight avir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "since only limited information was available at the time of permission for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing ads in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosting of Amprenavir along with low doses of knight avir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to the intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as capsule; therefore, amperase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for apitalase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Agenera Capsules are used without the addition of the addition of Ritonavir (Booster), higher doses of amatease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for apitalase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenase in combination with low doses of knight avir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Amatease is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of amatease capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunctions, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Normally, amatease capsules should be used together with low doses of knight avir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of amatease and knight avir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of amatease with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normised Ratio), methods for determining the substance concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given to amprenavir at the same time, the patients should be monitored at Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if also low doses of knight avir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propyl glycolcontent of the Agenera solution for inclusion, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Amatease should be removed in the duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many patients had other diseases related to their therapy, which were associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemmarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic latitude Accorase with Ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver have often been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already enters St John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and reduce the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg rite avir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetical study to be used in combination with didanosin, but due to the antacid component of didanosin it is recommended that the receipts of didanosin and agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and knight avir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and knight avir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised because Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with agenase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazol once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-ins) to 2,69fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may cause interactions when used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advised that Antazida will not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it may cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, niodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by 10 by Amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous seizure with agenase can greatly increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days on subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of agenerase with kritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to have marked increases in plasma levels while taking Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased in simultaneous injection of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, agenase cannot be applied together with Midazolam, which is taken orally (see Section 4.3), while at the same time it is advisable to be careful with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if also low doses of knight avir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation of how amprenavirus dosage is adjusted if Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenera, increased control of INR (International Normised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of knight avir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as apitalase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful balancing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amprenavir is passed in humans into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the evaporation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period Amprenavir, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenase's harmlessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the agenerase-treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or another medicine applied at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROJ3001, PROAB3006), in which with protease inhibitors not pre-treated patients received 1200 mg of apache twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), assessed by the investigators as related to study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and faecal subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (Stiernacken).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernacken) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In patients receiving 600 mg of Agenase twice daily along with low dosed Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception made increases of triglyceride and CPK values, which were observed in patients who received agenase along with low-dosed Ritonavir, very often.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary support measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins with the result of an unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of prenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other knight avir-doped treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 closed, with protease inhibitors did not show pre-treated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) on patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance tests, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples generates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of the treatment and another against tidenavir), the indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early termination of a seeding treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (viruslast ≥ 1000 copies / ml) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average variation in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-vacuum shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbridled asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, a generic solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose rite avir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study had plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbridled" amatease should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of untied amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4, or a CYP3A4 substrate, must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, amperase solution and apitalase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunctions is likely to be low on the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were present in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8-fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the acceptance of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and for the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse-mutations tests, mouse lymphom test, microcore testing of rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes, was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of apache nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure that was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans, a number of minor changes including thymus-ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenera Capsules are used without the addition of the addition of chionavir (boosting), higher doses of amatease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for apitalase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with low or minor liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function problems, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normised Ratio), methods for determining the substance concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Amatease should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg rite avir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nipendipine, niodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days on subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agenera, increased control of INR (International Normised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin from Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, therapeutic optimization should be taken into consideration with PI pretreated children of the expected benefit of "unbridled" amatease.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of untied amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or because of the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made from several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there is currently no data available about long-term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of superficially basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">No clinical experience is present in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended for pre-treated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is less likelihood of response to imiquimodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomic positions outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratoses on the forearms and hands do not support the efficacy of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment can be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study reveals that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulatory properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can be quantified either after one time or after multiple topical application, no recommendation is given for use during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently shared and probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects in the trials involving three weeks of treatment were local responses at the site of the treatment of tilt warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as probable or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod-Cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related adverse effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with imiquimodine-cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that these placebo-controlled clinical trials with imiquimodine cream often lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreting / scraping up (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study plan, the clinical signs indicated that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream very often found severe erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and to severe deformation and sticking (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies evaluating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) was detected at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent, unique oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotony, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after topical use of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowards in an imiquimodine treatment was superior to over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of all patients who were treated with imiquimod, the cowards were completely cured; this was the case with 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's efficacy in five times per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">The patients had clinically typical, visible, discreet, not hyperkeratotic, not hypertrophic lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 area of treatment on the uncomfortably scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">One-year data from two combined observations showed a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external incline, actinic keratotic and superficially basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore were not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, Placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies with the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three-weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and numbed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-ill skin of patients at the age of 6-12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratoplasty or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen-weight; a study on dermal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with finite administration in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has little systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low as a result of systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − When one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignizen (Condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of the genitalia (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to abnormalities, especially in the face - that is why early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are harsh areas of the skin that occur in people exposed to sunlight during their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used in case of flat actinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream assists your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratotic or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used aldara cream or other similar preparations earlier, please inform your doctor before starting treatment. o Do tell your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Avoid the contact with eyes, lips and nasal mucosa.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not carried out under the foreskin, swelling, thinning of the skin, or difficulty in retracting the foreskin may be expected with increased incidence of pre-skin narrowing.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use Aldara cream in urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">If other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should not use this medicine for more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse during the infection with cowards in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream is after intercourse (not before).</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently used it, even if it is non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream not because it is not known whether imiquimodine overturns in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in incline, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the hands and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with inclination under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks each week, a sufficient amount of Aldara cream can be applied each week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Very common side effects (to expect more than 1 out of 10 patients) Frequent Side Effects (with less than 1 out of 100 patients expected) Several side effects (with less than 1 out of 1,000 patients expected) Very rare side effects (with less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected) Very rare side effects (with less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Aldara Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A degraded number of blood cells may make you more susceptible to infection; it can cause you to get a blue stain faster or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which resend within 2 weeks after the treatment is put down.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, deformation, skin destruction, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, warmth or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal irritation, swelling of the eyelids, throat pain, diarrhoea, actinic keratosis, redness, face swelling, ulcers, aching limbs, fever, weakness, or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitation devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study examined mainly the safety of the medicine, but its efficacy was also measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60% and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review and update any new information that may be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will monitor patients who receive aldurazyms in response to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe BV a permit for the placing of aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -l-iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -l-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyms should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial induction rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyma may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effects that occur during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies to laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience concerning the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity after interruption of the treatment has to be cautious due to the theoretically increased risk of oversensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting the infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or anti-pyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed by reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the preceding response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data in newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended that the treatment with aldurazyms is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions observed in the age of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older are often reported in the following table (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing-stills and face edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged less than 5 years, with predominantly severe sequential form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion within 3 months after the treatment was started, with a more severe form of circulation in patients aged less than 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or until premature ejection from the study), no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with which it had never been serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low-low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient accumulation of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely about manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of the patients were of the central phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with aldurazyma showed an improvement in lung function and the capacity of the patients treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyma group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically insignificant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further proportionally to the size of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear drop in the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In view of the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes in normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe traverse form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the elderly patients with severe delay form were limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different aldurazyma dosing schemes were carried out on GAG mirrors in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusion; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemas is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetical profile in patients at age 5 was similar to those of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2348">The initial induction rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditioned involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing-stills and face-edema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • stomach pain • rash • Joint Diseases, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • Erredressed • fever • chills • increased pulse • hypertension</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available to evaluate each year, and if necessary, the package will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution was done under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the aldurazyma infusion (using aseptic technique) • determine the number of thinner flasks to be diluted according to the body weight of each patient.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine for cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicine for cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">For patients whose hemorrhage changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetremixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study on 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of amlimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin outlived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta longer than with the same medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to permit the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every penetration bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loc- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed dose as well as the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetremixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetremixed, a complete blood sample should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking account of the Nadirs of the hemorrhage or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must undergo further treatment according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 doses or so- on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65, or over 65 years of age, there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adaptations were necessary in patients with a creatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a function of liver function &gt; 1.5-fold the upper Bilirubin limit and / or transamic asenia of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marosuppression and Pemetremixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophilology has again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilology, platelet number and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous cycles of treatment (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 haematological and nonconjunctival toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was administered - if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) need to avoid simultaneous consumption of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with a clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effectory before phemetremixed treatment is to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving Pemetremixed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with a different cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application of attenuated living vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetremixed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm count prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 mg daily) can result in reduced pemetremixed excretion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses when using normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetremixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected for an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except if it is mandatory and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed exceeds mother's milk and undesirable effects on breastfed infants cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and were randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Side effects Frequency information: very common (≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on the available data from spontaneous reports).</seg>

<seg id="2419">The clinically relevant toxicity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three individual pemetremixed-monotherapies (n = 164), except neutropenia (12.8% compared to 5.3%) and an increase in alanine transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to lead back to differences in the patient population as the pha- se 2 studies included both chemonaive and significantly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2426">Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular insult and transitory ischemic attacks were occasionally reported in hospitals studies with Pemetremixed, which is usually given in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In clinical trials patients with pemetremixed treatment occasionally reported cases of coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">In clinical trials patients with Pemetremixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It was reported on cases of acute renal failure in Pemetremixed Monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were beamed before, during or after their pemetremixed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is a antineoplastic antifolate, which exercises its effect by interrupting important follic acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as an antifolate with several attack points by blocking the thyme dylate synthase (DHFR) and glycinamidrivesucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and Puritucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-center, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had clinically meaningful survival compared to those patients treated with cisplatin only.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm (randomised and treated) in the treatment arm.</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) associated with malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multi-centre, randomised, open phase III trial with ALIMTA for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was treated with median survival of 8.3 months (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months with docetaxel treated patients (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on overall survival occurred in favour of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate-epithelial histological type (n = 399; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.004 months, adapted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1,08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data of a separately randomised, controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetremixed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pre-treatment by docetaxel are similar.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The efficacy analyses of the PQ population are consistent with the analysis of the ITT population and support the non-supremacy of the ALIMTA Cisplatin combination against gemcitabine and Cisplatin combination.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, resulting in a quarter of the fats that are fed with food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>

<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be applied to patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (with insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indexed for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypothetical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 as insufficient data is available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only resorbed to minimal resorption, elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjustment of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if it is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated blood cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures to prevent the potential failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in multiple cases with concurrent use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normal ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E, and K, as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be advised to take a supplemental multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the medicine as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of reported adverse events detected after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to conversions with regard to potential or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects that can be traced back to the lipious properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect takes place in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bond to the active serine rest of the gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Derived from clinical studies, 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, has blocked absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypotheorical, fettrephased diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin with orlistat was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measured 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients given the minimally systemically absorbed dose, two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Laconring) and M3 (M1, after splitting the N-Formyl-leucine group), could be identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not make any special danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies that are moderate causes for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-emetic agent).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1,842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 out of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">Compared with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon assay patients should be closely monitored with anamnestial obstruction or sign of a subacute ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is required when using Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or those are prone to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy regimen, Aloxi is not to be used for prevention or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not block the activity of the five investigated chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single IV dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentrate oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorotin, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events reported at a dose of 250 micrograms were reported (a total of 633 patients), which at least may have been associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">The group with the highest dose showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective treatment for aloe overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 750 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life: 7.3 hours) were given intravenously in day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron given by day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of I.V. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV application follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours following an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional to the whole dose range of 0.8 - 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV application of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetical simulations indicate that, once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron on 3 consecutive days, the total text position (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with that of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an IV single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an immutable substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a unique intravenous injection in healthy eyes, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Admittedly, in patients with severe liver function, the terminale elimination of the elimination cornea and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects have been observed only by exposures, which are considered sufficiently above the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of preclinical studies suggest that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30fold of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is considered low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion, in which the approval of approval for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, and the values of the liver enzyme, alanine amotransferase (ALT), are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced to stimulate the production of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the medicine, efficacy, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference resin by 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment responded to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">E-mail: e-mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been raised that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease grew again in more patients than in the reference medical remedy; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine produces an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not validated adequately.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected firmation (cracking or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or believed to be caused by methicillindrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not act against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but under 18 years of age the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was gone after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation on the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo on the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections weigh over the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmation, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for placing Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by applying Retapamine Salbe, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointments are carefully wiped out and an adequate alternative therapy of infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retinobulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of retinobulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected to be expected in vivo due to the low plasma concentration that has been achieved in humans after topical application (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 At the same oral dosage of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole the mean retinosinulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary when topical retinosulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient with regard to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinobinulin is preferable to administer systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy should be weighed for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections applied to altargo, the most frequently reported adverse effect was irritation of the administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of conrod mutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly called Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50-subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding adjustment interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinobulin at least appear questionable at at least some forms of infection, consultation by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinosulin opposite S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamine Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 smeared skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the IC50 for PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of the in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinosulin in human liver microsoms was mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse lymphoma test and in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat-microcore test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female Rats signs of limited fertility in oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, making up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 smeared skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscification) and maternal toxicity were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorisation must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and marketed as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing agency agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application and all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot show you should quit the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointments are on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the inoculation plan consisting of two doses can be put to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or any other hepatitis C or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defence), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccinated vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but in the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses of twins, twins and twins are administered.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, maternity (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardisation Plan for Grundimisation with Ambirix is made up of two vaccines, with the first dose being given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refrescoction is required for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalous vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully backed up whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccination need to have a refrescoction as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody are under certain conditions, so that the administration of further doses of vaccines may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix cannot be injected subcutaneous as an exception in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measern- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thiomerint- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matiness based on a calculation basis per vaccination dose of Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who received Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable high per proband (i.e. across the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who got the Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per rehearsal, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In 289 individuals whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3-dose compound than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines obtained either a 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme to the in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year coincided with the freshening of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 haemophilus-influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotect- and seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is examined both before and after resusendium by eye on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines Ambirix (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that harm the liver or cause symptoms similar to those associated with hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or the tongue. • If your child has already an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">If you are at a risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccinations, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dosage (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected with people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / his body's own defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis / subtract.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child take more medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated recently / has been given or has been given immunoglobulins (antibodies) / or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as many different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix will not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgent to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other ingredients of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) with you / your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has been known since the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP points out that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was only brought into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incompletely enzyme defects or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided up to several single doses of meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">It can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste conversion, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The CHMP Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with the metabolism of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval there was only limited information about this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme that manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication for use when a hyperammonionic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the emergence of esophagus ulceroses if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys occurs, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also delayed stimulation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenyl acetate is excreted into the mother's milk and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials involving AMMONAPS, 56% of patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal uterine patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5 month old toddler with an inadvertent dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity at intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The predictions of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborn infants were previously almost always infectious, and the disease itself was leading to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogy.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen deposition (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at postpartal (but within the first life-month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygote form of the ornicotine deficiency syndrome), who were treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, mean the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Even existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients another worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, and phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were calculated using a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate for sober healthy adults and in patients with liver cirrhosis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenyl acetate in plasma could be detected in the plasma after a different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses) were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Secretion The medication is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate with toxic and non-toxic cans did not have any indicative effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrointestinal tube or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat corneas were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), lesions were found in the brain cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal uterine patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram of biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients another worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can only store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot secrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding time, you should not take AMMONAPS because the medicine could pass into the mother's milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, subletting of ear, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for instance with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress lifting" (an abnormal measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxin with sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as cunmab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year overall as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who have undergone a PCI, angioxin related to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other miludine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angioxin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is followed by a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours can be resumed according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg must be given immediately prior to the procedure followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately following IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole type of bolt of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolus should be of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully blended before applying, and the dose may be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second stud dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second stud dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivalirudin Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angioxis contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Angiox treatment can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heat.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a perkutane coronary intervention (PCI) may undergo bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR-value (International Normised Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after treatment with bivalirudin is again achieved before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytica or thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), these agents can increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudine with platelets of platelets or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional heat parin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin group and the groups treated with Heparin, there were more common adverse events in women and patients over the age of 65 than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined following the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding, as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudine plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed haemorrhage concentrations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point-points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients who are PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the groups treated with Heparin were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organism classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately broken and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombic inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as on the anion retention region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombine is present in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bivalirudine at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part split the bond of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine with serum from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) had no thrombocyte-aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivalirudine shows a dose and concentric anticoagulatory effect, which is covered by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was followed by a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or by PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients submitted within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography and PCI) are represented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-day and 1-year risk difference for the combined ischemic endpoint and its components for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>
<seg id="2934">Patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol were given arm A Arm B Arm C UFH / Enox Bival B- A C- A Bival + GPIIb / IIIa + GPIIb / IIIa risk diff.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding in both the ACUITY- and the Timi scale up to day 30 for the whole population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol is shown in Table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Patients, the aspirin and Clopidogrel whole population (ITT) according to protocol received UFH / Enox Bival Bival Bival + + alone + + GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor Inhibitor% inhibitor (N = 4603) (N = 4604) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperito-neale, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-fold and triple end points of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2) are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angioxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that bivalirudine as peptide is a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminally half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, gene otoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The toxicity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to the 10-fold of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to exaggerated pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects caused by long-term physiological stress as a response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical use, even with much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose flasks of type 1 glass to 10 ml, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injections are given into a flask of angiox and slightly swivelled until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the water bottle and diluted with 5% glucosal solution for injection or 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or to process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body can not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human-normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lucsin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced heat-ogenesis and decreased insulin metabolism, the insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">The type of insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc lag, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dose or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the course of conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopylline, Fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphate, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the influence of Sympatholytica such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic antagonisms can be weakened or lacking.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between intra- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is passed into human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed according to clinical trials which are known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organclasses and arranged according to decreasing incidence of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on availability of available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog-ger, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, resulting in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a properly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the efficacy of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin sensitivity increases faster and the duration of action is shorter than with the normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male subjects aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellit- tus, insulin lulissin in the therapeutic relevant metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosesis effect, and at 0.3 e / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosal effect, just like Human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosesis effect about 2 hours earlier than Human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a similar post-denoundenal glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denounced control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin in 2 minutes (GLULISIN before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin by dosage 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normal-maline, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
