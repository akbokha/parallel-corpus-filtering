package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
for more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard inser@@ tion modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that perhaps more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete .
the module An@@ ter@@ Filter ( also called Ord@@ inary Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; filter the current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and then open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : document@@ ary@@ , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps grants the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily , can be detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display a rect@@ angle representing a file or a folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for the easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of a different file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying or if the area of child rect@@ angles is to be used ( and therefore display errors occur due to restrictions on the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap &apos;s performance algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame requires space that is then no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how split@@ ting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for let@@ tering and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frame always advantageous that rect@@ angles arise that are as square as possible . the best methods of this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum space for an entry on the menu item View Vie@@ wing in Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed for the use of C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you access the module image gallery , a dialog box opens , with which you can specify the image of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to adjust the number of mini images of each line in the gallery .
to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image with the check box , determine whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
when displaying the file size of the image , determine whether the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , determine if the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the File selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set up the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
with the check box original images , make sure to copy the original images to the gallery .
with the comment text box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; edit . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; edit ; work together .
&amp; edit ; includes fast image editing with base image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing skills can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; cc@@ d ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ code ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; edit ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains one entry Problems or requests report .... This opens a dialogue with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get to &amp; edit ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to submit in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ code ; will also be used as an al@@ b library . settings edited by editing collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folder . &amp; edit ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; edit ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can be done by you by placing one point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have any photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can be in &amp; edit ; create your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Reci@@ pi@@ ents to manage your photos in the albums .
shell File Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can edit &amp; edit ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flows .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; edit . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; edit ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a disk drive device . the camera will also be used as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , shared software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; edit ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably . the Ex@@ f support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do &amp; edit ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common mod@@ ulation structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ code ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to carry out itself .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ m , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to select the most common features : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind he symbol view is displayed .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ent@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a shared name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos when you want to add or delete collections from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums After Date sort .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , New ester : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of any file in this folder will be used instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; edit ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ en@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; edit ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My Key@@ word List at the bottom of the main window . album @-@ collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a while while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this by re @-@ creating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview . which information is available , you can edit via Settings . select the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are everything what it was about &amp; digi@@ da@@ zed ; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as it fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can select all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ code . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image ... or the context menu of the image with the right button of the mouse , and Edit ... Select . in the editing section ; image editing you can see how to edit your photos . image editing allows you to view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; edit ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File type sub @-@ menu . for this , and how you customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing , other image processing programs can cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; edit : provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ code ; delete it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin from &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image er@@ ase or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ders quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; used for it either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et at the bottom of the date view so that you can only show the photos of the days selected .
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your tags lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My cue lists ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or to an existing keyword , and then select New keyword . if you want to add a new keyword , after you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and in the context menu Edit menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album title in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you click the right mouse button of the photo &apos;s context menu and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved above this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame which displays the time unit . this will display all the associated images in the main window .
in the box below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
ne@@ atly he search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds hits . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab@@ s in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and search will be done . the results will be displayed in the View My Search list in the main window . the text field Save search as is used to select a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection after the search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you find more rules for searching . more information can be found in the Advanced search section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ code ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ archiv . all rules will be added to the search group by operators . one option can be added to this list by operators all ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... can be linked . furthermore , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NE@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ code ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare pictures by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every image to find a similar . by using a spon@@ ge , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color scheme : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ code ; find the matching images . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble miniature program . you can move in or zo@@ oming out with the mouse wheel . push it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o @-@ Filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; edit ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add to the lumin@@ aire from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; edit ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window pane is to be seen . if you want preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and carry zo@@ ological and / or deportation operations on one of the images , you will also be able to compare the same range of both images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it on the left . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can recognize on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you have to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold the preview in the preview , then both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview mode .
what is a digital asset management - aside from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect and re@@ use your pictures . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; we view downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group@@ ing , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ers and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find a particular photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; edit ; . the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive sometime .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location , unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files are matched together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; edit ; to enable EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data to be written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? add &amp; edit ; provide them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign keyword , let@@ tering and an evaluation to each photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
now let us take key words , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ code ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are all the properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let anyone see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ code , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as label . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually rep@@ licate your travels via images with geographic information . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually rep@@ licate your journeys by pictures with geographic information . this also shows the photos at the recording location . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information on the furnishings page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information you should :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , for example to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author @-@ line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s working name . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this , in the image , digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ code ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be handled carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ proprietary format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturers reserve your statistics for themselves . their vendor ar@@ ants include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives :
the most common cause of error is S@@ MA@@ RT . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot determine this error . some of the errors fixed by S@@ MA@@ RT are termin@@ ating the imminent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power loss before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not matter much , this can be done differently on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage to your computer . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money even before the inevitable result .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and ear@@ ns the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . but remember that not each connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that even all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system can also be accessed . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on @-@ the @-@ go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to save your data and run down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . finally , remember how well your computer is protected with it . finally , remember to always burn all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
however , you are at home very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services which are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution Online . the professional version will provide you more in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
the web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo to one day . it is rather disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not concerned about transmission problems right now , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of bugs per year already in 2010 .
it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of workplace systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the popular file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are heading towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . thus , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neigh@@ b@@ oured house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete sn@@ apshot of two time points : that of the complete backup and the last difference protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system the next with the exception that it is only trimmed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase the security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure lets you find enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot for each month .

so precious pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to act as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have sc@@ aled the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t depend on it .

open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format was adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed for the need to uni@@ fy the camera image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original image , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format can be avoided . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online met@@ a @-@ data standards that support a wide range of mission and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , card reader or scanner . as long as images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a finely @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images , edit the metadata again , then you should add the metadata again , which may be trun@@ cated by other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edit ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ archiv .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn on the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . some cameras don &apos;t have thumb@@ nails available . some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and symbols for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page strips properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as the Met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; edit ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; edit ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend checking if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the ones you want with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button selected is gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; edit until now ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
the list of existing albums is shown as normal folder . you can read the list of existing albums as well as normal folders . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; edit ; upload the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by using the Del@@ ete Clear All . if you only want to delete some , you have to select it first and then delete the selected dele@@ tion .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so check carefully if the photos were successfully downloaded from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera completely , you should do this about the camera file as this is much faster .
the file names are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames in case you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this option , a folder will be created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information will be copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ os@@ % Y@@ - % % % % H : % M : % S in the edit field . then turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to modify the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case by downloading . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time .
&amp; edit ; can use all information about the camera &apos;s orientation at the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ code ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was made available , you can use it to automatically create sub albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a section side@@ bar , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; edit ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; edit ; you know where the images should be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot about where exactly the photo was taken , you can click a click to open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply want to document the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is easy to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data enter the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a couple who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must store this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and the GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tools by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ denti@@ fied coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; edit ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; edit ; change . to access these settings , you have to select in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select Action can be displayed on Embedded preview or image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; edit ; set if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; edit ; . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be in &amp; edit ; imported without being lost .
image lab@@ eling as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . note : in pictures which already contain cap@@ tions , these are over@@ written by the labels .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edit ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; attempt to view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ hing right from each category .
this page can be set to the default values . each time you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings can be switched on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , you can only use on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better visibility results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image files need more time to pack and pack .
with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality as the de@@ late algorithm works loss @-@ free .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; edit , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed color balance , based on a white card photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned in , because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as pier@@ cing white . the setting colors will generate some unusual results , since it displays the pointed lights in various ros@@ at@@ ars . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the digital image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , since it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from one color space to the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ ders Fol@@ low the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of the ICC @-@ profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ administr@@ ated not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera controller and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not adjust for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the t@@ onal mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore work very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; node ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface &amp; digi@@ code ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ code . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks executed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings brief commands .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the display .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Auto detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the picture display mode .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , on which you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it all here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to delete a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and er@@ asing an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ code ; if you use the changes to the right side@@ bar without any questions , you will have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also edit &amp; edit the welcome screen display ; when starting at startup , it may speed up &amp; edit the start @-@ up process ; .
if something from the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ code ; you know if it should delete them from the base folder .
different color schemes can be in &amp; edit ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ code , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; edit ; includes a quick image editing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of previ@@ ew@@ ing and selecting the entry / editing item .
image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; edit ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , displaying fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used Save or Save the Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore Button or Rest@@ ore Edi@@ ting button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last Save .
almost every image editing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting and re@@ covering editing by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by moving the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom in in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ gle menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come in the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool bar is displayed . if you don &apos;t want to do so , you can change it from the edit dialog ; view the main window . see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; node ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Export Control Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
this &amp; digi@@ code ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the Apply button or simply change to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then stored .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the valuation is written in the ur@@ gency of IP@@ TC . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used previously in this &amp; digi@@ code session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword ( IP@@ TC field ) .
when multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word Fil@@ l section .
the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keywords and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and filed there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control section .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string which is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options will look like this :
why didn &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not be listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; edit ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor reflect those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflow . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result .
if your image workflow fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
your only other picture editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about colour management ?
a visual example of limiting s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ze my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ ze your monitor , since s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor is working in s@@ RGB so you either need to c@@ alli@@ ze your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to manually edit .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Adju@@ st@@ ment and Con@@ trast expand from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction try to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest dot will be as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it only produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a relo@@ cation of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can get too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can perform white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the top right there is a hist@@ ogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shade adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or di@@ mming down .
to play with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
store buttons as and store exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set you can hereby save to a text file and relo@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the h@@ elli@@ sm . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the Color Management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to also save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
this &amp; digi@@ code ; tool color effects provides four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect created by using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ o@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , it embelli@@ shes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the thickness of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ance of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can carry out can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple den@@ ote / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool adju@@ sts sound value correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog on this tool appears very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here . more concrete the three slide gates beneath the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slide valves are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and watch how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . previ@@ ew@@ ing is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear presentation is most useful . in pictures the large areas of a constant color include the linear hist@@ ogram dominated by a single column . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ges .
the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
exit : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input values . the compression of the output rate can be used , for example , to create a light image as background while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and relo@@ aded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input will automatically adjust for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogram entries for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over @-@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right :
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a c@@ rank@@ shaft to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker cut@@ outs and that will dark@@ en the image pixels .
on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you will see the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the Menu C@@ olo@@ urs @-@ Mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first clu@@ e how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is the tool for creating magnificent black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour @-@ bre@@ wing . the color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise @-@ acts that do not appear in the same position in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer settings can save you later and then load . the used file format is the gi@@ mb@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over @-@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . maintaining the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating due to their ability to abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography , black / white is a step in which color images can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the s@@ add@@ ons . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a wall painting on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied to the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool box add can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the moving eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . penet@@ rating the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , de@@ can@@ ted it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ch@@ ery effect and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features like you need it . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set must be . finally , just select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the menu Image template can be used in image editing can be used to stack templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set the folder folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus , as well as most digital images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process can be summari@@ zed with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points on paper are printed . SL@@ R cameras normally need more retro@@ fit than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images a camera is often used internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , have to be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing focus . this can be done with the menu entry in correc@@ ting sharp@@ ness .
however , you should be careful with this , as the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing a picture is to re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rection Soft and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or viewing reinforce the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will generate close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should sharp@@ ens pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference sum . this allows for a minimal difference to be defined for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore f@@ law errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the image is blur@@ red with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
this &amp; digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is the use of a blu@@ r mask .
in practice , the circular fis@@ sion is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche thread . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche thread has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the swelling pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen flag is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes unwanted results .
circular focus : this is the radius of the circular fis@@ sion . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should result 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your blu@@ r is Gau@@ ß &apos; . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matri@@ ces size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the ann@@ ular edge or the G@@ auss &apos; edge . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left some unpleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp masks always have to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the blu@@ r . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blu@@ r mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the smoo@@ thing knob puts the blur@@ ring of the range that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homo@@ geneous regions and allow details to be sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
wavel@@ ength Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 only smoo@@ thes in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD @-@ noise will create a high value wavel@@ et @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the level of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is much noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular blades &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out .
store buttons as and store exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts coming from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel need and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller mistakes adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details will no longer be preserved , and noise or lubrication rec@@ edes again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all noise can be removed or noise tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically sli@@ pped more strongly . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of phase @-@ j@@ itter @-@ absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the reduction you set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how drug reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ tw@@ ood with the menu entry Cor@@ rection soft@@ ness and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adjusted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture replacement is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
store buttons as and store exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures were reduced to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts created by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
this &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixels of photos to remove with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly afterwards to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and relo@@ ads it automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the following filters :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo @-@ format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many Center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use with Center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects arise through movement .
with the large exposure area of today &apos;s film and color or gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a c@@ aged filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection turns the transformation into a picture using a C@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the level of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the default density is 2.0 , giving an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or accidentally a light intensity of 2 , increase it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re@@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a light and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ dient treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the fourth grade co@@ efficient correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , sound @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Parameter has the revers@@ ed sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values .
the ton@@ ing or cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or sizing changes . the best way to do this is to make this correction first . if you have to cut a picture anew and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect is apparently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ing / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the blan@@ king tool in the Transform@@ ers menu or via the zoom control of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters to set film gran@@ ul@@ ator and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Inclu@@ sive film gran@@ ulation option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control alters the amount of the film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter mixes color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of an infrared filter applied to a landscape photograph of New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter film gran@@ ul@@ ator is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ny effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the color drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter en@@ grav@@ ings your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , lun@@ ar landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime by pressing the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in blu@@ r : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that form a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographed from a car or a train , camera .
sof@@ tly blur@@ red blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amor@@ ous photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size doesn &apos;t grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of the drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ code ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you want to start the Filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Transformation rot@@ ting or transforming mirr@@ oring .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharply ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes here a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is much noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Store buttons are used exactly . magni@@ fying each single image for photo can be saved as a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo , you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut away . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the editing button to edit image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save file entries under the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cut off aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high @-@ format , the larger value is always assigned to the height and the width of the width . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative page ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . relation button to cut the area to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co @-@ operation help make it possible to hide help so that you can better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden center is a division that is divided into various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates on this way a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye becomes the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral , discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens very easily that you don &apos;t keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
to your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Transform@@ ers function from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally C@@ utting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out at a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after that you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
sciss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ oring tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sc@@ aling , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two form@@ ulations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&amp; edit ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ code ;
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; edit ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , &amp; digi@@ code ; the file can be displayed in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful guides in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can download raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ code ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; edit ; contains more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . edit these formats and will generate preview for the films . &amp; edit ; but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies .

if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , you can do the first four adjustment with the White Balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; edit ; contain . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform type of dialog indicating the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image .
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical split without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected preview area .
split vertically . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be used to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble miniature program . you can move in or zo@@ oming out with the mouse wheel . push it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for Pal@@ ettes Files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten @-@ files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or search the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the Pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end sign , if another color follows . if so , if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; included , are out@@ dated according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; node program .
&amp; c@@ alli@@ graph@@ er ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ ph ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; node ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; posters ; re@@ counts the graph and appears in &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; in a &amp; posters ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; c@@ alli@@ graph@@ er ; is a &amp; node ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list contains the last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; file loaded by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; c@@ alli@@ graph@@ er ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings k@@ alli@@ graphi@@ e.com ; set up ... use , see also .
if you want to open a graph outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; instance , open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; instance , or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
at the start of the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is to be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
when using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed across several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Up@@ load page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time a graph is requested .
the site seat management gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked at each start afterwards .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces representation according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular way according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , then run by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter and output the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; algorithms , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default duc@@ r@@ he custom to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file will appear . please remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import Settings &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above .

if you choose to change the size of the photos before upload , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization correlation . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above to see dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a sp@@ ool file with GP@@ X file . this file contains naturally data that were taken at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera time zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS @-@ time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below it , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no tracking data from one location for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog moves from a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed card . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the tab choice allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you just need to select the albums in a hierarch@@ ical way . the three buttons on the right hand side can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . therefore , you can read the messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and past@@ es . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Cli@@ ent is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital Camera Cli@@ ent currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the ailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG @-@ en@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG @-@ encoding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start creating the MPEG slide show up the module .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it go black . you can set the name and path of the generated file using the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button Ko@@ eln . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go to a coffee fast or calm@@ ly and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a note appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right down .
the printer wizard makes it possible to print several images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import / convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information on your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently , or use it later , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ it information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , margin size and background color , will be adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images you want to send before . more pictures can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the image window will display the images you have already chosen . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last image selected , a preview will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you have already been attached as attachments .
don &apos;t forget to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after adding comments to a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under image file format and the original JPEG format , the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ dates will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you want to have your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show fil@@ en@@ ames &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images random@@ ly select make sure that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select a different effect in each transition between the images .
during slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch on .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; co photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person you will see only the images on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use it with a photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , select which view you need to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t own suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you have to decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the picture @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and select the Image categories @-@ Editor in the context menu . here you can adjust the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a character sequence in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may either be part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; co@@ op album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you want &amp; make photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select Help menu entry to Photo@@ Album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar shows you here : . as the name implies , this bar shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in preview view .
you can also select an area of time line by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of this time period will be displayed in the preview screen . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album is described ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created that is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first of all you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after creating your images , you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do this work with &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; co photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all images to the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option for this dialog is whether it is about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the manually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the Automati@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Automati@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you still want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... you will be able to import the exported database as described in .
the Assistant to Import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alise the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named by your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories to match them in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it must be easy to browse and see pictures : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups and m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; C@@ photo@@ album ; mem@@ ori@@ ze the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the different settings options .
to the left , you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview settings and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is provided by pressing the F1 button and clicking on the option you want .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , set up all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a group as explained in .
in the list below , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . more information can be found on the Ki@@ pi homepage .
the modules can be called via the Module Module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used together with each other together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always try new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database can either run via command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; kis@@ sing album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can easily arrange their pictures in albums . even if you don &apos;t support this kind of order , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , you have to add a photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if your browser displays the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will be able to do so , so do if you have selected persons to view this and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the setup dialog and select the modules that modules should be loaded .
on the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; co@@ op album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . at the moment there is not very much information , since you have not yet entered any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the people who are on the picture , where the picture has been taken . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you type information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can , as a result , that the used names are moved up to find people faster and assign them .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are below the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a parent . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the comment dialog contex@@ tual menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply place an entry on a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry . note , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bottom edge of the frame . you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer opened , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview screen . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window will display you can see in the picture .
&amp; co@@ op album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without being stored on the hard drive . of course you have to store the images somewhere , so that you can record them in the database index . in the picture you will see the View from &amp; Co @-@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . this is , for example , in the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy them . so if you want to avoid irritation , like the mess of your pictures , please buy a bigger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the Settings menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make for others and click Ac@@ tual view bar in the Privacy Menu . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister can see , and select the menu item Any@@ thing except current view .
with this you have defined what images should be hidden in case of case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock to unlock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy Menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private images .
the reason why you &apos;re all your pictures with &amp; kis@@ sing album ; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , features &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then pop @-@ up context menu can be seen below .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture High and Picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . then download a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l and plus or minus keys .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom into the image . zo@@ oming in the middle of the image with the Min@@ us button . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key @-@ key , the zo@@ oms set , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
you can rotate the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu . this will not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you might prefer to select the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to draw pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in this you will see a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set characteristics on your pictures , they are available in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just tag all of them with notes . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the device preview window , then you can add characteristics to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be able to paint on the picture .
the column will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can reverse your painted later .
in you can see a picture on which was painted . to turn on the coloring mode of &amp; co @-@ photo@@ album ; select on the picture from the pop @-@ up menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed yellow in the wire model views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu item .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this Chan@@ ges . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply and disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thus changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a viewing stage as a wire model . they can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window @-@ orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the acc@@ user to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the acc@@ user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to remove a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ ber@@ strip .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the side@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
you can save the current window view with the window ordering view ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 is up @-@ to @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon To render the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene .
a render mode is equivalent to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View Mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot; &quot; &quot;
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the size card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination field quality you can choose the properties that use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super sampling moves the adjacent pixels with inclusion . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split up again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further followed and tested for further divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on j@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays are not an object .
opens a new window for display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the file entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command Sum@@ mary of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your documentation and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. gra@@ dient data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you check high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projection , all wi@@ re@@ model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projection . this feature gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick the channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page , you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window ordering section , it explains how to create and store window @-@ orders .
the combination field Standard window ordering : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window layout at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window layout . new views can be created with the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Clear .
the position of the new window . with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with cart card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners is very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows the camera the whole scene that you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points to change the target point of the camera . simply click the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location .
when applying the Apply button or the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they view the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ less Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then push the button Apply or the input button . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view now also displays the level , albeit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise one unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a few times at the moment .
in both cases a dialog box in which you can choose how to insert the object . please choose first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = bottom @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you will see how the pigment is now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material , because you still have to type settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview . now , there are many possibilities again , but now take the simplest .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now by clicking on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , that &apos;s not the colors you expected . here are more settings needed . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic method of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the sphere as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to push the input button or the button Apply ) , so the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom of one unit down@@ wards .
of course the rendering follows a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select In@@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the gloss effect and reflection settings are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities to offer you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered , needs some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and memory .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you do not have any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command rever@@ ted . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used editing undo .
saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new .
open a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a pump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can click on &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set if each image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ; exit .
in dialog In@@ sert - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when you exit the last opened folder . open the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show to show only some of the file types that the program can display as well .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
set the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the key abbrevi@@ ations for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; also closed if no browser window is open anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ Photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or desires . this shows a dialogue with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ Photo ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ Photo ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , so you should be powerful in this language .
the best way to get involved in &amp; show@@ Photo ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ Photo ; to access these settings , you have to select in the Settings show@@ photo ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . the colors should be in contrast with what you want to view . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ Photo ; features a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; fl@@ lite ; is an application to scan images that no longer do than scan and save images .
&amp; fl@@ lite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer does than scan and save images . &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information you need on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; output . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
other settings include more detailed driver options . ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the button settings will open the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type of image . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images will be saved when saving without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for the Save dialog . the default is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... Change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is always uploaded every time a picture is saved .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; gu@@ il@@ li@@ tes ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; output ; . the button settings indicates the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; output .

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking on the player window and selecting short@@ cuts .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands . this lets you make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / template folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ths and control Amar@@ o@@ ths . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok imple@@ ments the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change has sign@@ aled that a new piece is pi@@ ped . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece query ( for example , the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use the d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ ize option ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to do cleaning operations . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b may have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the cat@@ chy cat@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to load should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permission :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you can easily drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s Colle@@ cti@@ ble Browser and Quick Search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still have a hard decision , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re @-@ experience your music !
typically , in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , it has some options that you can enable or disable to compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details , see the System requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in addition to displaying the player window , the player window will additionally turn to the playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window is displayed .
use V@@ oting Bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design more atmospheric : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
mood files in the music files : this function is only available when compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the preferences folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist in the end of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist during the end .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , so that the play@@ lists window will pop up / off to keep the each running piece in the visible window area .
when changing to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is pi@@ ped .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; set . by selecting your own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray shown section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist @-@ windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection user defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection activated below for foreground and background color .
continue playing at the start causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after the start of the program , playback automatically continues with the piece by which it has been stopped at the end of the end .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option of custom@@ izing the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the color selection dialog . if your own colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multiple @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD will appear .
the audio output cartridge card lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers will activate additional settings in this map board .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that is &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively search sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor Chan@@ ges : enables &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to add all found play@@ lists in your Collec@@ ting folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the Share Collec@@ ting Database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; under calcul@@ ator : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the load map last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ts : after activating this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar interpre@@ ts to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package of k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / in@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection be recre@@ ated .
it is mostly because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then des@@ elect automatic . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &apos; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; to $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you will have to click on a symbol in the Control Center under Ap@@ pear@@ ance Symb@@ ols . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any colon@@ izing Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only make a mistake there if you find something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only a blank playlist will appear .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the review columns must be displayed in the playlist . click the list bar of the playlist and select a column . you can also use the Quick commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just like you would do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar , next to the add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be What Media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with MP3 decoder in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with Hardware Mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and solve a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want to listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the enlargement of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you well .
either do not use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to obtain the faster arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; so ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download , compile and install ff@@ m@@ peg , once again as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the following register again .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; playback . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before going to bed , then you are arous@@ ed by the gentle sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running tracks when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ts and titles of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is available in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right @-@ click puts a piece in the queue in the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what then ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , you switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , take files from folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically this adap@@ ts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can set the rating for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the Play@@ list window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : review rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want you to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not to be brought together with Amar@@ ok &apos;s short @-@ term plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can find also ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click on New Design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; while browsing in kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add am@@ aro@@ k in the drop @-@ down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
presumably , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you have to configure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that separates the development files from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module is installed G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok &apos;s second sound@@ card ?
set up Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output gives you the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter x@@ ine @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and the output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box at sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not further looked after . you may of course enjoy this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in just a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag with the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will receive various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Audio @-@ CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on one entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have several options to burn a CD .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a player window with the most important functions .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a scroll bar displaying the currently running track or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the currently expi@@ red game time to the remaining game time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous bit .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you check the check box E@@ Q , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand , the playlist is itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there are now in other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; distributed . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded pieces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no script script is still running , you can choose which to run .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database .
the Search button searches a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com based on the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - Rand@@ om@@ ly , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All records of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically , and the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpre@@ ting .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize the group@@ ing at your will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field , which allows you to filter out the latest added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , ranging from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This le@@ verages the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ es - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected items as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn / Bur@@ n all pieces of this artist / Bur@@ n CD - This will not display the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various interpre@@ ters .
highlight composition - Change an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be shown under various interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
also created Intelli@@ gent play@@ lists are possible . click Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used to connect &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an input URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case holding down the Shift key can be helpful : thus dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all of the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter there letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the return button for a long time until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , then &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of them ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this is what Mike Old@@ field is looking for , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order of the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons follow undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you will see in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration via this menu .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bars , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can access &amp; am@@ aro@@ k via this menu .
one click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your large collection in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ determined ( the details to set up these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double @-@ click the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click the right mouse button on you and then choose loading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om@@ ly Mix and Play@@ list mix will instantly complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . this will also be disabled by the same menu entry .
the New Order button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist will open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
right clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the opportunity to click Edit . then , the dialog for editing the playlist settings opens .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not play a part in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed , taking into account the setting of pla@@ ym@@ ate pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces you have played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to tick more than one playlist , then you can add random pieces from each of the checked play@@ lists .
some scripts allow one &apos;s own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog where you can install a script package for installation . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button for further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted from then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the section writing scripts .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins will be used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , create an audio CD . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re@@ coding to MP3 , you will get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a loss@@ less format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project to do so .
in this dialog window , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this quick guide should show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn .
after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , press the button Start . you now see a dialogue that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as the reading of the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Bur@@ ns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Bur@@ ns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and learn some news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run @-@ through ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X audio en@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ mac@@ ger : a functional auth@@ oring system full of functionality for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically return all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and change . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it will be asked what to do with it , as if you would have called a file close .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is this ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this function only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you then can burn later . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD , which you will then burn later . in addition , the copying / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not supported yet , so the target medium must be large enough to record the total ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the content . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window normally appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the media .
the Content View allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the head@@ board is a narrow section , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature for this further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is designed to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; cc@@ d ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the accompanying programs give you a preference .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; node ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions to create new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copyright ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string parent ) void re@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many en@@ co@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( loss@@ less compression ) by default ( These code@@ c packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders is already available . all these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can circum@@ vent the protection , it is not possible to circum@@ vent the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid purchasing a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , with everything manually captured .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is being used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
start the CD@@ DB query of the CD data according to the request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an en@@ coder has been configured in the configuration file tab , encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder than the standard . it must be noted that before the en@@ coder has been configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead a complete &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
open the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ effici@@ ents and compression ratios and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important since both codes generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression ratio about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good Genu@@ ine for music by youths , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co @-@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if you use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution , if this has not yet happened .
to save the read WAV files , the code@@ c and thus the desired file format can be selected . for the first time , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the tab . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the co@@ ders can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ver is in the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio codes of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine as it is regarded as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have writing rights ( eg . try to copy something into the / usr / share / cd ) .
the first section covers the basic setting up of &amp; co @-@ audio creator ; , something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the code to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it for every reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
/ dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM drives ; and / or DVD drives .
there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information , select that you will be informed when information on creating key words ( tags ) is missing .
the flash@@ card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entry , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; node ; Tag@@ ger .
if you want to enter the database first , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b servers over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80@@ 80 protocol , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check out this to check out the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if only space on another drive is present . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything in the way it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of concur@@ rent WAV files at the same time : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
this is it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running . we will create and set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and want to fetch data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process described in this section must be repeated for every reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look slightly different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually insert data instead of picking them out of the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; current title &apos; field , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist no longer has to be entered into the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; field , unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the commentary field of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with upper case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 notes for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; the audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all the encoding or file formats . see the help file for more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the ex@@ ited CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the button All the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status line .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is encoding of part 1 to MP3 format . this makes reading and coding concur@@ r@@ ently . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . if machines are weak , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is en@@ coded in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code@@ c of your choice .
if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; node ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations in settings . the best way to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e how it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) , or from an unusually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot keep this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing to this proposal .
strange if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa will be involved as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the keys pressed on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the process used .
session support . when you finish &amp; scratch ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Ab@@ play from the Edit menu or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
once you play a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and starting with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template to change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item Pause in the Edit menu , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song lyrics and another both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song uses , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set the record . however , if you select the entry Automatic text choice in the Settings menu , you will automatically choose the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI Files that you summari@@ ze . these will be played in the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can select the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears in the File dialog , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be added automatically to the active collection when opened ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally added to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu subscription sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the next song , the next song from the Edit menu or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song back , select the button Pre@@ y piece , the entry Previous item from the Edit menu or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that transforms all of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally played a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you must edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all the required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI will be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 tools .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to record all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a bul@@ let ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , similar to a rif@@ le shot . to do so , enter the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( rif@@ le ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the word drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound represents a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and tool . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map notes on the perc@@ ussions channel . for example , take a look at the provided key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , you will always use patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . thus , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event will play with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find them in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the item Channel view : settings
the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , and so on . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow keys on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; node ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move windows and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ DLL . first , you only want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ str@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . currently I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they really make me happy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get any money from anybody . I would like to emphasize that I am only more programmed because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .

and of course , my thanks also goes to all these outstanding musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view pictures . you will also find links to pages with additional kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .

the application window is made up of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can only be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . just click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if you leave the edit mode or select another group without the same playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / Wonder@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing for the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; M@@ lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ appropriate &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . the started process is called pop player . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will reproduce all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this takes k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be used . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog can be found under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ ones .
are there any hints as to how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; edit .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is probably resor@@ ted to the package &amp; ly@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; lin@@ ux distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . they allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact should be made via the box ; website .
if you have any questions or if you wish to compile &amp; edit , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ y ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good review of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to master &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ } class , the body starts with the command \ \ start { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this is the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , articles ( DIN ) , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this will set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used extra packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed .
automatically complete the environment when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to lock the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( the highest and sub@@ section is the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file recovery can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file &#93; &#93; is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ cks ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the external output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are plu@@ cked with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of this is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , there is a jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is mounted on the inc@@ ess@@ ant , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick build .
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale multiple selection fields should be followed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the fast structure of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field further is for inser@@ ting items such as tags , notes notes or references . the available options are :
description : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or a different element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ ff@@ e is used for determining the font size . it can be specified to specify the font size for the main text , the marks , etc .
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the code sample above has to be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the quick build button .
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging . when using quick build &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font e 12 will be created and a different font should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } is intended to allow to change the font in the environment .
changes are only secured inside the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the intensive print and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be shown in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is now followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide to creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a little text has been entered in the wizard , a few modifications should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should be a quotation , a few points in the bold and ital@@ ics print and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( for internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a standard file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi issues such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools construction will be selected .
in order to execute the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on to preview search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; file and corresponding line . for this you need to set &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( Setup suite ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI connection , a fault can be found . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file respectively in the message window .
the log file records the source of errors in the source text . in the editor , the pop @-@ up Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for sy@@ ring@@ es . in order to view the incorrect line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; ki@@ p ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document .
when selecting Emp@@ ty document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground or used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ classes &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and carried through the steps described above .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; posters ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about Kate ; and his possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called over the Men@@ Ã ¼ Support La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par will be selected .
when pulling the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source code and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a special type of book@@ mark inside the text . the Men@@ Ã ¤ ger Edit jump stamps or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes allow the jump to the next or last jump mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although it offers excellent opportunities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands for text selection include :
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; box ; is that the gaps are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also displays &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example , a part of the document can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster opportunity .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under the Edit environment for a possible basic work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command termin@@ ates the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups determined by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sc@@ ented clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the sc@@ ented bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted welded groups @-@ par@@ enth@@ eses quickly the overview can be lost . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as hall@@ marks . for the appropriate implementation , the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple quotes .
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double quote characters can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there may also be specific settings ( e.g. German or French ) and thus German or French application signs . there are also many other languages available .
when using Shift ; Access button for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a table environment t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an attached line breaks off .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to assign columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the underlying line .
although &amp; kate ; already provides a good source code completion , it was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are several modes built in . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic finishing . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Ki@@ le ... Complete setup .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list will be removed . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions is possible with the Edit jump @-@ mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste J@@ umping brand and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete you can make adjustments to these lists . there can be different directory lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wi@@ pers of the general language use are selected .
command mode is not necessary for completing environments . a few letters with \ \ begin must always be entered and the execution mode call will result in a large e @-@ list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when activating the complete area or pressing Alt + Shift @-@ key Alt + Shift @-@ key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is complete , the environment is automatically closed again . once you see that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be checked .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... To@@ o ; Complete you can make adjustments to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of complete set @-@ up mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of deriv@@ atives , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Com@@ preh@@ ensive . as an example of a c@@ aching list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is included in the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the Men@@ Ã ¼ Edit Translation or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher is not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete registration for all already written approval .
this mode can be set up in the menu item Ki@@ le ... Take off boxes . here , also the threshold value for the display of completion can be specified .
the exec@@ uting files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( directory ) or tex .
the dialog graphics make the entry of graphics as simple as possible . for the inspection of the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to view the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the creation comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation may be the key element Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard @-@ faced viewer by means of Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open .
a new project will be added to the Project New Project .... for this purpose the following information is requested for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ pr@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly elaborate system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete Rep@@ ap@@ se for &amp; tex ; and it &apos;s a full @-@ time friend . this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for a particular format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or banners . from &amp; ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working area environment . &amp; ki@@ p ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; ki@@ king ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who strive for the survival of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use with respect to the &amp; GNU / License .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . the signatures work in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
random signature is an arbitrary signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will give you a blank signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have entered your signature , please save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click the Save icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then click Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing it in the tool@@ bar .
open the Di@@ alogue Start commands . here you can select short commands for menu items . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user @-@ defined button on the right of the button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for use of &amp; quot ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as interface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my opinion and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a bit , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no longer reli@@ ed on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done it !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the folder &apos;s folder , then let the current work folder be attached . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files ; files are deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the recently opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply let the current work folder be selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported error and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply attached . if not , delete the file from current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ for@@ med file is , click the Well @-@ For@@ med check selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; , specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file choos@@ er .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then leave the current file selected simply . if not , remove the file current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality right away and do not have to wait until someone builds the bolt in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we begin editing the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button S@@ etze as presses . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on remarks .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information on team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be showing the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
there can be either the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by note text .
comments can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where nick@@ name of the first name of the team member is , R@@ ole a role in the project in the following ways : team@@ leader unit or sub @-@ project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialogue extends over some pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags , including code completion , can be changed .
large / lower case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means that the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
exclude optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags .
automatically update the start and end date : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic set @-@ up of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default setting can be restored using the Standard button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than file opening files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is sto@@ cked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting will be sto@@ cked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; periodi@@ cally creates backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings for the next start is useful when the user interface is per@@ ver@@ ted by changing M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ schem@@ atic command line parameter .
the alert area is used to control the display of warnings by hook @-@ up of no more questions .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree can be set automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text while empty groups are such where no element has been found in the current document .
the section for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded when editing an extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications of third @-@ hand , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not located at a stationary like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select allows saving the entry also if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ Gen sitting starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the View Deb@@ u@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script , with error @-@ adjusted if possible in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there was no current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you can help to get better .
document type edit packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; features such as auto@@ complete and node space . their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag tool bars are handy , symbol @-@ oriented k@@ olo@@ dges of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about the conversion .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , A &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the tag dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to each other tag . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only exist once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a break @-@ break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; start the dialog and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor available via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be created by setting actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key symbol assigned to this action . by clicking on the user @-@ defined button a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut is removable .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the Det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , you can find the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process only . if from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard error output . it can be specified , what is to be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a custom tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the cup .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog if available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly icon . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs More programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size .
please note that the icon created not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regards to the tag start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green , usually as los , start , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is &amp; lt ; Start ; tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it still needs to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared by some divi@@ ders into several groups . open the tool bar to set dialog on Settings tool bar . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back up in the correct folder . after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) if a file is opened by the respective type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places , there is an E @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for what it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when you upload your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New Resources dialog , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK the upload will be started .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start from the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a notification appears with the indication of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there &apos;s the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should be published
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , adds &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it stores all that is selected globally in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool lists with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ ggles the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ Window , the tree views , the divi@@ ders with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing , relo@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
rect@@ angles in the editor area lead to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , when the string under the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter refers to a file .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of the editor , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with flash@@ ers stand for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of a right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category hangs from the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the relevant user and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in reference to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree is opened .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned to the content allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on how to find web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two divi@@ ders at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are some ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; node ; 3 in the PA@@ TH in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; node ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why development , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; node ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . through the program Com@@ mander , they can increase the automation of almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details see help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help _ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there included special characters to &amp; HTML ; description , so they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
extension and turn on the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
open an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects will be saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ z@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; node ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only creates the name . actions need to be set by settings actions ... are saved . tool bars are stored by tool bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or someone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refresh@@ ed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current Tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu item , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ as depends on the b@@ ill@@ boards ; version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate change@@ over between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that matches the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and change the sequences .
this should generate a help in accordance with the context of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name the file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ z@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ z@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
be attached when files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , do not hook .
with this option all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clip out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . you can upload these settings in the menu with project properties in the menu @-@ tree in the sub@@ window profile or shift with the Shift ; F@@ 7 short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations , such as project folders .
supplementary option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signature , are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded when the project is opened . you can read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed supports . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
Up@@ load profiles can be uploaded ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by adding an own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the Event configuration sub@@ window you can switch event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you cannot influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ z@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will happen . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are also active , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten during the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your short@@ wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to one &apos;s own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to design tool@@ bars is to use and add . the addition of tool@@ bars will be handled at the bottom of the add tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which new action , a New tool@@ bar can be created , it can remove other actions like tool bar , ren@@ ame tool@@ bars , or set tool bars , where can be specified which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool bar , the entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up tool keys in the menu ... and set Settings actions ..
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; basically uses templates such as a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you set up for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be of any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents are made in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in an appropriate way to be efficient .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ based .
as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Save As Tem@@ plate save as local template ....
once this has happened you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File Save As Tem@@ plate Save Sel@@ ection as Local / Project Tem@@ plate . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project file tree view , select a name for the template and back up . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can specify he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , paste or associate with them . additionally , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / app and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Notes / Qu@@ anta / She@@ ets .
to set a folder &apos;s behavior , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ ter@@ able attributes are attached .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template table . if a root folder would be set in this way , it would disable templates in this path , except they would be explicitly enabled . in the event of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or completed text for templates in this folder . this might be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows by copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p an entire presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached through the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the default of the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 mode activ@@ ates the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL ; View can be selected between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small split for fast computers and a large ap@@ ot for slow computers .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ sors is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typing and dropped by means of a button or removed button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the tables wizard or the lists assistant are disabled . later , they will work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , searching for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed .
to successfully compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , you need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; node .
halt in a template , in a place loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file names with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g file folder . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible :
in this command , it is checked for a partial or entire agreement with a presentation named QNAP or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP device containing the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a fragmented holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor under the differences windows allows resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both distinguish files .
if all files have the same name but are located in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by only writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
folder 1 folder , folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the opening dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and display it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
on the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or mer@@ ging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , a folder then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field for the target is active and can be processed . however , it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file immediately . you can also do this later when saving .
the In@@ sert button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to move text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at present you can &apos;t remove anything from scratch . only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any information line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well to see .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line dividing the Com@@ preh@@ ensive column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line of broken lines is scored .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Chang@@ ing &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in any mark you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , side , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the Pa@@ ste button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Out@@ ward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Out@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the tag to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option because you might accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line End files are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + new@@ line \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ .
the options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides variable width fon@@ ts , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed straigh@@ tened . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tab button is pressed . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
if you press En@@ ter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is not necessary .
you can choose which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
when comparing files , you try to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is compared to each line . in this step , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the cart return character , but then files may be disabled with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then this option may be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Automati@@ cally advanced mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to restart and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a quick note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) with this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress any changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C is displayed next to the normal one and a second over@@ sight column with the information you need .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply shut@@ down the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes view the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . together , a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the entry into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a super@@ script that matches all characters in a row . the \ \ 1 converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generating text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ norm@@ alities is required .
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ alization / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the index @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes without actually carrying out it ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you have to select the corresponding menu entry or press F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed by a small message about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared to that time will be listed .
when scanning the folders is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions fl@@ aps All sub@@ directories and fl@@ aps up all sub@@ directories with which you can open up all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , the age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : contradictory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : contradictory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ized directories . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging ; B nach A. )
if two folders are merged and the new file is selected instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file will work after the other . the status column displays Fer@@ tig when mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the combined actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C is used as a destination , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is selected as the target and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merge / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to create only the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . they can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with options passing , simul@@ ating and ab@@ rup@@ ting .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the actual changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( to merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , restart / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , then a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
when you run the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . so you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder @-@ specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ indication file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a hide attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links will lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders to a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when copying the change date . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the knowledge is provided that the other file was not changed too . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible while mer@@ ging single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der to the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn off the Windows menu main window and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder . to do this , use the current file mer@@ ging from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently known as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . first , K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Dec@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch patch to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the pop @-@ up menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by scrip@@ ting in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or who are going to go that way .
you have compiled the program from sources and probably not told the configure script to the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is more often the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly hal@@ ted ; No sr@@ c is left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; node , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems while comp@@ iling . if you encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will likely change in a later version of the program . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when you click on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual working areas . it &apos;s quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , exit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . movement is possible both within a working surface and on other working surfaces .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager . cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and end . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
if this field is checked , the names of the virtual working surfaces are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
cross this field indicates the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displaying the numbers of the virtual work@@ tops . if it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is checked , the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems only .
here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , all virtual working surfaces appear horizont@@ ally and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... allow the dialog settings to appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can manually do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must register as user root or contact your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; magni@@ fy a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fier for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ments . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag ;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as the selection window .
in the default setting &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter such as a mo@@ ve@@ able lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it using the arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , when you press Shift + Shift , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , relo@@ ading ( with the button document relo@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click brings pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may also feel pain caused by the use of your computer . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , avoid pain while clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the intelligent shifting activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait it until the end of the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the pulling with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must be c@@ logged after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if intelligent shifting is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , wa@@ its after the mouse button down before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports now clicking through mouse shift . if this function activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ est@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider set sound buffer that you tune to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the state after the last push of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times from &amp; node ; to reduce sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of where a mouse click is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not constitute a link does not lead to un@@ desired reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shifting in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can do a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want to have it . however , park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want a keyboard input . thus , a accidental moving of the mouse can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to highlight text , copy it to cli@@ p@@ board or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent shifting if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this time , whenever &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when intelligent shifting begins the shift time . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a drawing process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping using the mouse can also be done .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . you can select text passages used in text passages without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for the word supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can adjust the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a circul@@ ating memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have correctly set up , you can enter the sentences in the input field you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the flow memory . you can select from it sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , set the character encoding to be passed on to the language generator .
&amp; K@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as default .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
use q@@ t@@ d as a voice service &amp; mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings are ignored on this page . the kt@@ to@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down box action after selecting a text passage , you decide which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text Pass@@ say@@ ings menu or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage is directly spoken with the selection of So@@ fort . in addition , the selected text passage is entered into the input field with the selection of In the input field .
the second drop of the edit window for text pass@@ word@@ book allows you to determine whether the text log should be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text pass@@ word@@ book , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ word@@ book is not saved . select Before saving , gets &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ word@@ book is to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ter@@ Supp@@ lement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contains a list of dictionary text@@ books . in the main window , next to the input field , shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to only insert correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar , or a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt + key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory will be used .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool bar is placed by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu item is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; K@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . the bar is placed by default via the editing window directly under the tool bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you didn &apos;t enter the command for the speech output correctly or not completely . open Settings c@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the language output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a speech output system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows free use of the festival and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ve@@ file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax fon@@ dly swal@@ lowed the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option to send data as standard input must be switched on .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use q@@ t@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , let text pass through the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken phrases , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; K@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer included . a speech syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service allowing each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; node ; program@@ mers are ready to be equipped with T@@ TS skills with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ sync mail@@ ing@@ list . subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info / list@@ info .
before you can use it , you need to install and set the speech speech pat@@ cher .
at the first start of kt@@ gre@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the cartridge card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the tab card is displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different types of male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ enders for the same printer .
if you click on the Car@@ pa@@ gef@@ reiter Spe@@ aker in kt@@ gre@@ m@@ gr , the flash@@ card will be displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the main speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost using . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read text .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language extension system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the car@@ ton map will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD will stop and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; further if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ gre@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with buttons in this series , you can start , stop , stop and record text orders .
with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; node , cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flash@@ card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check mark voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ats ; run . then check the text that should be read and select text from the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step as well , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the enhanced text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ats ; run . then check the text that should be read and select text from the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you about events you &apos;ve specified . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ats ; read it .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up so that you will be notified when your nick@@ name occurs in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; node ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filters for character set @-@ up provide a good way in &amp; kt@@ ats ; incorrect st@@ ressing or er@@ ron@@ eous messages to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which comes to the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ats , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be accepted in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ats , filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of the warning .
news is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; have a long text read on a web page , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is just entering the room . &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you get from the flash@@ card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads this , this output will stop and termin@@ ate .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
character sets replace parts of a text by other text . the pieces to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ats ; is provided with pre @-@ defined string player filters , which enable the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; contex@@ ts ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice on the cartridge card speaker , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text continues to be passed on to the next filter .
when a text order , a notification , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fication is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in the series from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will display the following setup di@@ alogs below .
for setting up character @-@ chain replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ setzen . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied .
the character @-@ chain replacement filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character @-@ chain replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the c@@ equi@@ ti@@ ls package .
XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the auxiliary software x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available through the PA@@ TH environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the dial@@ up selection filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker set up on the card speaker or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; when a text is handed over to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that the program sends , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker will be able to over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click it with a click on the button to get help when typing .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which is most likely to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech syn@@ thesizer , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the website Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the dict@@ t@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; cons ; window . first start t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . that &apos;s what you have to do if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and you can find the PA@@ TH environment variable .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is emit@@ ted . what can I do about it ?
first make sure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string of characters . see .

K@@ T@@ TS also works with each voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages listed above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . also see the section of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that is not yet included in this manual .
the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand , please contact the development team for the use of another syn@@ thesizer .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bark@@ ing or downloading the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , first check whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . for this you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program dict@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can leave set or paragraph , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be used . if you want to learn more about how to extract it , see how to extract a speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab on the map , and then click on Edit , the cartridge screen will be displayed . for example , the module &apos;s setup for festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter festival .
select the text encoding for text that will be handed to the festival . if votes are known , this setting will be automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak do not use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you set the volume , speech speed and pitch of the syn@@ thes@@ ized language . if you cannot select some controls and this grey is displayed , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you do not have a speaker set up ( or click on the user to click ) .
if this check box is selected , the t@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed on the start of kt@@ gre@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the tit@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ gre@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the Spe@@ aker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card speaker .
with buttons in this series , you can move forward or back in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ els , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has to be selected , either without support for the corresponding audio module or extract it ; it cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % roughly twice the normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processes four types of speech applications :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you can read a long text on a web page , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to be able to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the flash@@ card noti@@ fications will appear .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; node ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are reported by &amp; kt@@ ats ; not read before .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are from &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &apos;s to do ; when an event occurs , you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard chooses the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the car@@ tel card speaker .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently supported and kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since it is the standard voice that uses the festival in the edition of SS@@ ml .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start reading text into individual sentences . this allows you to start reading faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ats , a set limit detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other rules limiting filters , but beginners will be advised .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the language selection by trying out . turn off the choice of speakers and enter text to read . check on the chart list , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed . you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then start reading faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the flash@@ card , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit identi@@ fiers compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ B ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set limit identi@@ fier , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ sharing card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu , you can over@@ ride the language settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no talk properties are specified .
use of the most suitable subscri@@ ber that displays all the characteristics of an established subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best meets the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t give anything .
select this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you may wish to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one inserted in the working environment .
to delete all the properties in the area Spo@@ kes@@ person , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker , and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required ) .
kt@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command sequence @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by this , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music at the same time with another application . when I get a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ats ; ein . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find information on potential solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ gre@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / sourc@@ ts@@ d / int@@ on@@ int / vocals . as a guide , please include the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio board audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modules like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) disable either the filters for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set the speaking speed up .
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival doesn &apos;t produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert SS@@ ml to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own character @-@ chain replacement filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more to move forward or back . on the tab order is displayed , the order only consists of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filtered out . instead , use a filter for limit detection instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling in &amp; kt@@ ts before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience clas@@ hes with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; also freeze if you stop a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; pause , the current set will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , sign up as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :

before you use it , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA @-@ syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phone from German lyrics . more information can be found at .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; - Vo@@ ices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you do not need to re@@ compile the error correction , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; )
on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this method uses special code to issue the language via festival with a Czech &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; grab and install first Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PA@@ TH .

festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech syn@@ thesizer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech syn@@ thesizer with sufficient voice quality .
Fli@@ te is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for Fli@@ te as the first one on the CDs of your distribution .
Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage syn@@ thesizer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice syn@@ thesizer generates the sound , but the support is currently limited to few languages .
load at least a German language file from the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip to the / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA folder .
copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c needs to be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame .

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console , on the command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; it enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf to show the device at all and allow the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed in the installation of &amp; lin@@ ux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the Network Set@@ ting , this option attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and release date . by checking the settings no @-@ re @-@ questions , the definition can be determined dur@@ ably .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . by clicking the button System Administration Mode , you get to the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three Reiter :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to set up in the Dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available .
selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
selecting Manu@@ ell can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . switching on a switched @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface .
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only understand IP addresses . if the host asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down@@ right in the priority list .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the dialog Edit .
the Nam@@ eless Well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
usually the list of Nam@@ ed hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known machine and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; if the known machine has several alias names , press the add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit .... Edit Calcul@@ ate Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module &apos;s network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , and in the second section all of the configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is given .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely distributed , and IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator can use the contact point , which is a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , so their use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for IP for@@ warding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are located and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections so it will not be surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is trun@@ cated by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which moreover provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated from &amp; k@@ dat . this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat , trains the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the tape does not , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched through the entry for the tape .
prior to ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; shows by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a band from &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band@@ pass must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . this process requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , proceed with the format of the tape . all the data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Safe menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can even check the selected files and change the backup settings .
the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the verification process has been started , the dialog appears settings for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to Check . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that should be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ ore appears . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file based on the content of the band . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ write the index to two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it will be backed up , located on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the other files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is integrated the command is loaded to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . it may not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy stre@@ amer .
is the option turned on , trying &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat - in any case the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only record a block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; node ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system places the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual ways to sort and filter will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if you do not see it , and it opens a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after input strings . the list of the log lines is now changed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed . then a protocol line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . in addition , in the protocol file system log , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . note lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the level indication . the colored description of protocol lines can be switched off alignment dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example , in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ strip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add new lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the main window context menu to view all the new added protocol lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log message from the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V in@@ it system is rapidly becoming standard for controlling program start @-@ up in the &amp; Linux system ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V in@@ it without making a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . the Linux kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to run when you boot the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use of it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something while driving , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can repair it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ time to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ ners or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will not remove the entry from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you remove an entry from the domain of the available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : at present there is no way to restore items thrown in the recy@@ cle bin , so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve experim@@ ented with the standard round level@@ n and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) just termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adju@@ st@@ ment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after making changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have enabled advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD un@@ xes .
the file password management will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this flash@@ card appears only if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation .
the Groups menu provides information about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group belonging to the user can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
