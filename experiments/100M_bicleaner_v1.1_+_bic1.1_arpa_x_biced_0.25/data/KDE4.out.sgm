<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page, where you can paste text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard insertion modules from the box kde; addons. please note that perhaps more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; for crash, or the list of crashes, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module AnterFilter (also called Ordinary Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; filter the current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and then open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, example: documentary, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps grants the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily, can be detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap display a rectangle representing a file or a folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for the easy recognition of the nesting depth or the image of a different file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying or if the area of child rectangles is to be used (and therefore display errors occur due to restrictions on the character of the treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap's performance algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this frame requires space that is then no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for lettering and avoidance of space losses through frame always advantageous that rectangles arise that are as square as possible. the best methods of this are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum space for an entry on the menu item View Viewing in Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets designed for the use of Cachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module image gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the module image gallery, a dialog box opens, with which you can specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to adjust the number of mini images of each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="31">In the File selection Save to HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box, you can set up the subfolder with a slider or a rotation field, up to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box original images, make sure to copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the comment text box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box sele color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in & edit. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & edit; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& edit; includes fast image editing with base image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing skills can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & edited; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata such as & eg; via the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & ccd; programs is also & digicode; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& edit; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains one entry Problems or requests report.... This opens a dialogue with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam; however, you can ask questions to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & edit; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to submit in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you'll be asked where to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicode; will also be used as an alb library. settings edited by editing collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folder. & edit; looks at each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& edit; thirsts recursively the library path throughout its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it iste in hidden folders. this can be done by you by placing one point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have any photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can be in & edit; create your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Recipients to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Shell File Support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can edit & edit; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh-Workflows.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in & edit. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & edit; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is then used as a disk drive device. the camera will also be used as a disk drive. the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">GPhoto2 is a free, shared software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & edit; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably. the Exf support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do & edit; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modulation structure for & digitised;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicode; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digikam; to carry out itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in a different part of the Albenbaum, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to select the most common features: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter works on the filename only if this ind he symbol view is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlientquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the albenproperties or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a shared name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos when you want to add or delete collections from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums After Date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, New ester: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of any file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & edit; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlienquot; this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& edit; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My Keyword List at the bottom of the main window. album-collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a while while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this by re-creating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview. which information is available, you can edit via Settings. select the albums page and adjust the area thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything what it was about & digidazed; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as it fits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can select all the functions that come with & digicode. you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image... or the context menu of the image with the right button of the mouse, and Edit... Select. in the editing section; image editing you can see how to edit your photos. image editing allows you to view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & edit; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File type sub-menu. for this, and how you customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing, other image processing programs can cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& edit: provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digicode; delete it will be moved to the trash bin from & kde; moved. F8 image erase or Del if you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumsliders quot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digicode; used for it either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select one month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet at the bottom of the date view so that you can only show the photos of the days selected.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your tags logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My cue lists; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also re-import your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keywords, or to an existing keyword, and then select New keyword. if you want to add a new keyword, after you click on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and in the context menu Edit menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album title in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event in which it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you click the right mouse button of the photo's context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved above this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame which displays the time unit. this will display all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Neatly he search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds hits. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and search will be done. the results will be displayed in the View My Search list in the main window. the text field Save search as is used to select a name in My search list. if you want to change your selection after the search again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you find more rules for searching. more information can be found in the Advanced search section.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "if you want to delete an existing search from the list, select" "" "Delete" "" "in the context menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicode; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albenarchiv. all rules will be added to the search group by operators. one option can be added to this list by operators all..., A..., No... or At least... can be linked. furthermore, you can create search of type & quot; AND NECHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicode; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare pictures by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every image to find a similar. by using a sponge, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color scheme: draw a quick sketch and & digicode; find the matching images. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble miniature program. you can move in or zooming out with the mouse wheel. push it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your Geo-Filter. this is then added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& edit; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the luminaire from the contextual menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window opened. if you are back in & edit; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window pane is to be seen. if you want preview synchronize from the toolbar and carry zoological and / or deportation operations on one of the images, you will also be able to compare the same range of both images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas to the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it on the left. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can recognize on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you have to click on them and hold the & LMB; hold the preview in the preview, then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are previewed in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital asset management - aside from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect and reuse your pictures. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; we view downloading, rename, remove, convert, grouping, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confers and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to find a particular photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & edit;. the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location, unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files are matched together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & edit; to enable EXIF and IPTC data to be written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? add & edit; provide them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keyword, lettering and an evaluation to each photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let us take key words, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicode; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapped. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are all the properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let anyone see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicode, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as label. you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually replicate your travels via images with geographic information. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually replicate your journeys by pictures with geographic information. this also shows the photos at the recording location. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information on the furnishings page of & digikam; as information you should:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, for example to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author-line): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's working name. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this, in the image, digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digicode; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, plate failure, power breaches, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be handled carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. also read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers reserve your statistics for themselves. their vendor arants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives:</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common cause of error is SMART. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot determine this error. some of the errors fixed by SMART are terminating the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power loss before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not matter much, this can be done differently on devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage to your computer. so protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money even before the inevitable result.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and earns the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. but remember that not each connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that even all peripherals connected to your system can also be accessed. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on-the-go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an interruption-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to save your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS can be used for less than & euro; 40. finally, remember how well your computer is protected with it. finally, remember to always burn all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, you are at home very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services which are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution Online. the professional version will provide you more in case of Flickr more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs are at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you open a photo to one day. it is rather disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not concerned about transmission problems right now, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of bugs per year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">It is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrf filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of workplace systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the popular file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are heading towards the 10 megapixel. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. thus, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget airplane accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboured house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: that of the complete backup and the last difference protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes to a versioning system the next with the exception that it is only trimmed and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase the security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you find enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata stored in the image file IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, recovering images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So precious pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to act as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have scaled the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been detected by the system, but don't depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & quot; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 #</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit pro color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format was adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed for the need to unify the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original image, mostly in raw format. XMP adapts to the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format can be avoided. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online meta-data standards that support a wide range of mission and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, card reader or scanner. as long as images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finely-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images, edit the metadata again, then you should add the metadata again, which may be truncated by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edit; in the addition of a photo to an album, you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albenarchiv.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicode; to use, connect them to the computer, turn on the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. for some cameras it may take a while. some cameras don't have thumbnails available. some cameras do not provide thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and symbols for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page strips properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as the Metadata page bar from the main window of & edit; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from your camera into a single album in & edit;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend checking if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the ones you want with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button selected is grayed until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available. these images have not been downloaded from & edit until now; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is shown as normal folder. you can read the list of existing albums as well as normal folders. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & edit; upload the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you want, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them by using the Delete Clear All. if you only want to delete some, you have to select it first and then delete the selected deletion.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so check carefully if the photos were successfully downloaded from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera completely, you should do this about the camera file as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames in case you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and the time the image has been taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the standard auto-identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information will be copied into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix fotos% Y-%%%% H:% M:% S in the edit field. then turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name option, you have the option to modify the file names in lowercase by downloading. or in uppercase letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digicode; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& edit; can use all information about the camera's orientation at the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, & digicode; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced tab and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was made available, you can use it to automatically create sub albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded in the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta section sidebar, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case saves & edit; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & edit; you know where the images should be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be identified by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot about where exactly the photo was taken, you can click a click to open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or simply want to document the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is easy to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data enter the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI-module for geographical allocation (manual) and finally via manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a couple who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must store this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of pictures and the GPS. on the following page, you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTools by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentified coordinates created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& edit; tries to give you as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behaviour of & edit; change. to access these settings, you have to select in the Settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on Embedded preview or image editing. you set the default behavior of & edit; set if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should be a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & edit;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be in & edit; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labeling as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. note: in pictures which already contain captions, these are overwritten by the labels.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode; attempt to view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the button Refreshing right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">This page can be set to the default values. each time you open the luminaire, these settings can be switched on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, you can only use on fast computers. if you have one then you can get better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image files need more time to pack and pack.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option compress the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality as the delate algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG-2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & edit, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. default is to use a fixed color balance, based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as piercing white. the setting colors will generate some unusual results, since it displays the pointed lights in various rosatars. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the digital image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, since it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information from one color space to the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folders Follow the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-administrated not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera controller and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, which do not contain any color-tonmapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not adjust for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the tonal mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore work very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for what is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & node; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface & digicode; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will be loaded by & digicode. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks executed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings brief commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a button Auto detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the picture display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / s, on which you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicode; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can paste it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the trash bin, you can adjust the conversation of & digikam; to delete a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and erasing an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly supported by & digicode; if you use the changes to the right sidebar without any questions, you will have to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also edit & edit the welcome screen display; when starting at startup, it may speed up & edit the start-up process;.</seg>
<seg id="334">If something from the base folder was deleted, asks & digicode; you know if it should delete them from the base folder.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & edit; used to adjust the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicode, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edit; includes a quick image editing with some base tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of previewing and selecting the entry / editing item.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & edit; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the section editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, displaying filename, current file number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used Save or Save the Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore Button or Restore Editing button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done in the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every image editing action can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting and recovering editing by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by moving the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom in in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Angle menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come in the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the tool bar is displayed. if you don't want to do so, you can change it from the edit dialog; view the main window. see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard & node; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Export Control Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">This & digicode; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply change to the next image, the captions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The valuation is written in the urgency of IPTC. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used previously in this & digicode session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed various keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword (IPTC field).</seg>
<seg id="365">When multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword Fill section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keywords and search views. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set to No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and filed there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control section.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options will look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why didn't Picasaweb or Flickr not be listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & edit; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor reflect those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflow. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callize my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callize your monitor, since sRGB assumes that your; onitor is working in sRGB so you either need to callize your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to manually edit.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Adjustment and Contrast expand from the menu Correction Automatic correction try to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest dot will be as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it only produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a relocation of all values in-between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can get too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can perform white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right there is a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shade adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Store buttons as and store exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set you can hereby save to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be done by the subwindow for the hellism. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consulted in the Color Management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to also save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">This & digicode; tool color effects provides four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect created by using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Veloaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the thickness of the neon light. in large pictures, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminance of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can carry out can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple denote / contrast / gamma, the tool adjusts sound value correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog on this tool appears very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more concrete the three slide gates beneath the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slide valves are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. previewing is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear presentation is most useful. in pictures the large areas of a constant color include the linear histogram dominated by a single column. in this case, logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammages.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to interactively change the output values as in the input values. the compression of the output rate can be used, for example, to create a light image as background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input will automatically adjust for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the histogram entries for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over-exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a crankshaft to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker cutouts and that will darken the image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over-exposed pixels. if found in more than one channel, you will see the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the Menu Colours-Mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first clue how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is the tool for creating magnificent black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour-brewing. the color-brewing consists of small noise-acts that do not appear in the same position in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer settings can save you later and then load. the used file format is the gimbp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over-exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. maintaining the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating due to their ability to abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a step in which color images can be easily converted on the machine. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the saddons. this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Use the & digicode; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a wall painting on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the picture below. the original image is (1) and the modified one (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicode; tool box add can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the moving eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. penetrating the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), decanted it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a butchery effect and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any location. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. use text execution, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features like you need it. the bigger the image, the bigger the character set must be. finally, just select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicode; tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image template can be used in image editing can be used to stack templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set the folder folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">The preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicode; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus, as well as most digital images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process can be summarized with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points on paper are printed. SLR cameras normally need more retrofit than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera is often used internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, have to be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening focus. this can be done with the menu entry in correcting sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should be careful with this, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening a picture is to refocus the tool. you can achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a bit softly is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Correction Soft and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or viewing reinforce the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will generate close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpens pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference sum. this allows for a minimal difference to be defined for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore flaw errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). the image is blurred with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">This & digicode; tool refocusing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fission is much better than the Gauß'sche thread. the Gauß'sche thread has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the swelling pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'schen flag is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of the circular fission. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should result 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter when your blur is Gauß '. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrices size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the annular edge or the Gauss' edge. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left some unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masks always have to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the blur. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing knob puts the blurring of the range that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and allow details to be sharp. a value of 0.9 should get details so that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Wavelength Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD-noise will create a high value wavelet-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the level of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular blades [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Store buttons as and store exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicode; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts coming from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel need and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller mistakes adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details will no longer be preserved, and noise or lubrication recedes again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all noise can be removed or noise tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically slipped more strongly. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase-jitter-absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. when it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the reduction you set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how drug reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the softwood with the menu entry Correction softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicode; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adjusted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture replacement is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Store buttons as and store exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts created by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">This & digicode; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixels of photos to remove with a CCD camera gem, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly afterwards to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and reloads it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the following filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digicode; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo-format, can frequently illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use with Center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blurring effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure area of today's film and color or greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a caged filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction turns the transformation into a picture using a Centerfilter. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the default density is 2.0, giving an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a light intensity of 2, increase it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use gradation from the color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a light and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicode; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. color distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The fourth grade coefficient corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, sound-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameter has the reversed sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The toning or cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or sizing changes. the best way to do this is to make this correction first. if you have to cut a picture anew and then perform a tonal correction, the effect is apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the toning / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the blanking tool in the Transformers menu or via the zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra-film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters to set film granulator and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the Inclusive film granulation option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control alters the amount of the film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of an infrared filter applied to a landscape photograph of New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicode; Filter film granulator is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix big silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granny effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grained effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicode; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicode; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The color drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images of whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicode; Filter engravings your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicode; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, lunar landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom in blur: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that form a focal point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotating the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographed from a car or a train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly blurred blurring: blurred the image into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamorous photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Blurring: blurred the image by random shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your images a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size doesn't grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the visual effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicode; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you want to start the Filter Regentropfen the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Transformation rotting or transforming mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharply? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes here a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Store buttons are used exactly. magnifying each single image for photo can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo, you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut away. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the editing button to edit image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save file entries under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "in the tool" "" "Cut off aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in high-format, the larger value is always assigned to the height and the width of the width." ""</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative page ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relation button to cut the area to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the orientation orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the co-operation help make it possible to hide help so that you can better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious ponds are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden center is a division that is divided into various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates on this way a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye becomes the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral, discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens very easily that you don't keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transformers function from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically Cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out at a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After that you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the scoring tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the image is blurred a bit. for a single scaling, this effect is mostly negligible, but two formulations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling, the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& edit; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicode;</seg>

<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. links of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical split without duplicate. the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally, without duplicates. the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">Split vertically. the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Divide horizontally. the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'mouse over 'style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that can be used to display over- and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble miniature program. you can move in or zooming out with the mouse wheel. push it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for Palettes Files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Paletten-files, which are installed by & kde; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog palette, you can select from a list of installed palettes or search the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the Pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>

<seg id="725">& graphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphviz; included, are outdated according to the program author & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgrapher; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & node program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& calligrapher; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graph; programs are free layout programs. & graphic viewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & node; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; on. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & posters; recounts the graph and appears in & kgrapher;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & posters; to open or to open the graph in & kgrapher; in a & posters; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & calligrapher; is a & node; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgrapher; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list contains the last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot, the main window looks like in the bottom of the screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & kgrapher; file loaded by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or if you want to ignore the change. & calligrapher; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item settings kalligraphie.com; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph outside a running & kgrapher; instance, open, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgrapher; instance, or to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph is to be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">When using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed across several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Upload page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph outside a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time a graph is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The site seat management gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of & kgrapher; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or determine to be asked at each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directional graphs. the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces representation according to the spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a spring-spring model for ungerified graphs. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node in a circular way according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, then run by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter and output the calculated layout of the graph according to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; algorithms, or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (judged or unexecuted) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read new images and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. at present, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry image, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. choose the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by selecting the default ducrhe custom to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file will appear. please remember that type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the Import Settings &gt; Screen Photo... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the complete desktop only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to show your photos to the people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, display the photos of your camera and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication. so it's your ID to Flickr. a browser will be launched so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you are welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. at the moment you need write permissions. the module also supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as words during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlation. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above to see dialog appears then. to create a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a spool file with GPX file. this file contains naturally data that were taken at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the timezone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation gives an upper variance for the GPS-time and camera time. if the deviation below it, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no tracking data from one location for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in min can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. as the dialog moves from a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed card. select the region and increase sie.Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encoded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted. the tab choice allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you just need to select the albums in a hierarchical way. the three buttons on the right hand side can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option for each image creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically be closed. therefore, you can read the messages to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and pastes. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information. this can be found, for example, in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera Client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module Digital Camera Client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the ailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG-encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG-encoding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can start creating the MPEG slide show up the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it go black. you can set the name and path of the generated file using the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie with the button Koeln. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go to a coffee fast or calmly and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard makes it possible to print several images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import / convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera maker. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information on your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently, or use it later, you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exit information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the option to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the orientation orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, margin size and background color, will be adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images you want to send before. more pictures can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will display the images you have already chosen. you can add more images using the button Add images. for the last image selected, a preview will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images you can open the New message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you have already been attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't forget to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After adding comments to a attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under image file format and the original JPEG format, the original exifdates will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Module Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like you want to have your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">OpenGL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the option" "" "Show filenames" "" "ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select make sure that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly select a different effect in each transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower left edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & co photoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person you will see only the images on which both persons are to be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use it with a photoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, select which view you need to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you don't own suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you will need to open the picture-view window (in more detail) and select the Image categories-Editor in the context menu. here you can adjust the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a character sequence in the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date may either be part of the total date, i.e. for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window, you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, according to images, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & co-photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather like to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & coop album; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you want & make photoalbum; for the first time, or select Help menu entry to PhotoAlbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & co-photoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar shows you here:. as the name implies, this bar shows you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of time line by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of this time period will be displayed in the preview screen. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Cphotoalbum; provides you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & co-photoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & cphotoalbum is described; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on the photoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & co-photoalbum; export file should be created that is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. therefore, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First of all you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & co-photoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do this work with & co-photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & co photoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all images to the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold way. first it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialog is whether it is about internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manually copy option to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "with the Automatically" "" "Automatically" "" "option to the .kim file, copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you still want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... you will be able to import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Assistant to Import consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalise the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named by your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the file to be imported and which categories to match them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and see pictures: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups and mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass the various steps of (1) determining the information about your images, through (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Cphotoalbum; memorize the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re-use it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & co-photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will find the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview settings and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is provided by pressing the F1 button and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the dialog Options, you can set up complete members groups, i.e., set up all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a group as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">This module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. more information can be found on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the Module Module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & co-photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with each other together, it may be that the modules were tested with & co-photoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always try new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database can either run via command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI together are very different, making it possible that some modules with & co-photoalbum; not work. this is the downside when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kissing album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can easily arrange their pictures in albums. even if you don't support this kind of order, it simulates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & co-photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & co-photoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, you have to add a photoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here's a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If your browser displays the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, you will be able to do so, so do if you have selected persons to view this and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & co-photoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do this, start the setup dialog and select the modules that modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & coop album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. at the moment there is not very much information, since you have not yet entered any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & co-photoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with notes. this includes information about the people who are on the picture, where the picture has been taken. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & co-photoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you type information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are mapped, you can, as a result, that the used names are moved up to find people faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you might want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are below the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a parent. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog contextual menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply place an entry on a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub-category of this entry. note, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bottom edge of the frame. you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you would like to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer opened, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview screen. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now the window will display you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& coop album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & co-photoalbum; you can also use pictures without being stored on the hard drive. of course you have to store the images somewhere, so that you can record them in the database index. in the picture you will see the View from & Co-photoalbum; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. this is, for example, in the pictures 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so that & co-photoalbum; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires that you copy files from the folders and re-copy them. so if you want to avoid irritation, like the mess of your pictures, please buy a bigger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Settings menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make for others and click Actual view bar in the Privacy Menu. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that your little sister can see, and select the menu item Anything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined what images should be hidden in case of case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu item to lock pictures, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click Lock to unlock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the Privacy Menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you're all your pictures with & kissing album; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, features & co-photoalbum; about an image _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the then pop-up context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture High and Picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. then download a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl and plus or minus keys.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can enter the image and zoom into the image. zooming in the middle of the image with the Minus button. the Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key-key, the zooms set, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu. this will not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you might prefer to select the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to draw pictures with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in this you will see a picture in which the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set characteristics on your pictures, they are available in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just tag all of them with notes. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view. if you can view categories in the device preview window, then you can add characteristics to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will be able to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The column will not be saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see a picture on which was painted. to turn on the coloring mode of & co-photoalbum; select on the picture from the pop-up menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar top at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully master, but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed yellow in the wire model views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit, or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply and discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview of the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as a default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, thus changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a viewing stage as a wire model. they can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window-orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the accuser to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the accuser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to remove a view from the anchorage, drag the Anfasser to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamberstrip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the sidebar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with the window ordering view... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual has been written, & Povray; 3.5 is up-to-date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon To render the symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode is equivalent to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"" "if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select" "" "View Mode" "" "in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the picture, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can choose the properties that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling moves the adjacent pixels with inclusion. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split up again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further followed and tested for further divisions. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, changes & Povray; the beams are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays are not an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for display of & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the file entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command Summary of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your documentation and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. gradient data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you check high detail fidelity for advanced projection, all wiremodel views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projection. this feature gives a better approximation for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the window ordering section, it explains how to create and store window-orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field Standard window ordering: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window layout at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window layout. new views can be created with the button Add and Delete selected views with the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with cart card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners is very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows the camera the whole scene that you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points to change the target point of the camera. simply click the left mouse button on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When applying the Apply button or the input button, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they view the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endless Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then push the button Apply or the input button. in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only find the default options for each new object: scale, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise one unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a few times at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box in which you can choose how to insert the object. please choose first subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = bottom-Pigment), with a click on the Preview button you will see how the pigment is now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments shows only a matt black material, because you still have to type settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on preview. now, there are many possibilities again, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now by clicking on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, that's not the colors you expected. here are more settings needed. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicolor. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the checkerboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree select each time monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic method of working of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the sphere as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to push the input button or the button Apply), so the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom of one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering follows a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the sphere, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select Incolor and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection settings are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even if Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities to offer you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracysourcing is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer is shooting hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene that is to be rendered, needs some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and memory.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to select only if you do not have any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command reverted. this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used editing undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; modify commands or add new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A pump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files you can click on & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if each image should be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as & amarok; short commands. this lets you make your keyboard to & amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / template folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amaroths and control Amaroths. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script needs to take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok implements the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange has signaled that a new piece is piped. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece query (for example, the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use the dcop amarok script addCustomize option (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry, you can use dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to do cleaning operations. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb may have downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the catchy catokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to load should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permission:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok, you can easily drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a specific title of thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's Collectible Browser and Quick Search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if you still have a hard decision, choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to re-experience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Typically, in the base folder of Amarok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report it to the & kde; mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, it has some options that you can enable or disable to compile time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiler options, certain dependencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used. for details, see the System requirements section.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Save Playlists when you exit, save the current playlist in the end of & amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist during the end.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, so that the playlists window will pop up / off to keep the each running piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is piped.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of various fonts in & amarok; set. by selecting your own fonts, the otherwise gray shown section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist-windows, player windows and context browsers. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. if on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadows causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option of customizing the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color areas opens the color selection dialog. if your own colors do not use, the preset & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can specify which screen of a multiple-monitor environment the OSD will appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output cartridge card lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers will activate additional settings in this map board.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that is & amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively search subfolders: this causes & amarok; both the crossed and their sub-folders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor Changes: enables & amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & amarok to add all found playlists in your Collecting folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Share Collecting Database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field Driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & amarok; under calculator: will the host enter where the MySql database is located. afterwards, the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package of kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & amarok; requires some of them to for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / inarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and let the collection be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & amarok; is a bit more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deselect automatic. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use at least 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the file $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $ARGV [0]\ '$MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print' Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ 'to $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist) always look active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known error in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes, you will have to click on a symbol in the Control Center under Appearance Symbols. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amaroapp: symbol lookup error: amaroapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check whether Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any colonizing Qt or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please only make a mistake there if you find something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only a blank playlist will appear.</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the Start subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for rating by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review columns must be displayed in the playlist. click the list bar of the playlist and select a column. you can also use the Quick commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a blender allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with Hardware Mixer (e.g. SBlive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and solve a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. ossesink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want to listen to a white noise. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. the enlargement of the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help you well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia complete to obtain the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & so;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>

<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (end Amarok before!): - Download, compile and install ffmpeg, once again as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the module folder (you will find the module folder with the-config / GStreamer-config) and run the following register again.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & amarok; a player window with the most important functions.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window is a scroll bar displaying the currently running track or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the currently expired game time to the remaining game time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will appear in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also located under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set the equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous bit.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you check the check box EQ, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of functions they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand, the playlist is itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there are now in other parts of & amarok; distributed. furthermore, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "the" "" "Recommended pieces" "" "are the favorite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no script script is still running, you can choose which to run.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & amarok; s collection database.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button searches a search on google.com based on the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - Randomly, the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All records of your collection are sorted alphabetically, and the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpreting.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize the grouping at your will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection field, which allows you to filter out the latest added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, ranging from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leverages the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queues - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Adds the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn / Burn all pieces of this artist / Burn CD - This will not display the selected pieces to K3b and either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1377">Select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a composition, whereupon it appears under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight composition - Change an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be shown under various interpreters, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist contains the smart playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also created Intelligent playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used to connect & amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you're done click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an input URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in this case holding down the Shift key can be helpful: thus dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all of the pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter there letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the return button for a long time until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, then & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination of them).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this is what Mike Oldfield is looking for, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order of the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you will see in the player window over the right mouse button. you can set up & amarok; 's configuration via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for toolbars, for example rendition controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. you can access & amarok via this menu.</seg>

<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predetermined (the details to set up these will follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double-click the desired playlist, drag them to the playlist window or click the right mouse button on you and then choose loading. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes Randomly Mix and Playlist mix will instantly complete your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist Recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection. the Recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of play, so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point. this will also be disabled by the same menu entry.</seg>

<seg id="1464">Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is this? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD-Project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you are not using files for a multi-session CD. it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This function only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD-Project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD which you then can burn later. additionally, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a DVD, which you will then burn later. in addition, the copying / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not supported yet, so the target medium must be large enough to record the total (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW disk.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD ± R (W), which will completely delete the content. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a source of data that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">The dialog asks for a * .iso file as a source of data, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window normally appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the video, encoding settings, and even ways to change the size and cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b;. if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlocking the drive or ejection of the media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headboard is a narrow section, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headboard has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature for this further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is designed to personalize and fine-tuning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & ccd; -applications also, equipped with a & DCOP interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the accompanying programs give you a preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & node; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void copyright () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void addUrl (QString parent) void addUrl (Qstring parent) void reameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString Newname) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; read out for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoders that encode these WAV files (lossless compression) by default (These codec packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). further coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders is already available. all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the Chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction about coders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can circumvent the protection, it is not possible to circumvent the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid purchasing a copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found), afterwards the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; collect information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, with everything manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is being used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB query of the CD data according to the request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the configuration file tab, encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard. it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that an already read file is selected to encode instead a complete & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, beeps) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coefficients and compression ratios and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences become less important since both codes generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression ratio about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good Genuine for music by youths, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you want absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or retrieved from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the co-erer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if you use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution, if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the codec and thus the desired file format can be selected. for the first time, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the tab. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the coders can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information on Kodiver is in the Chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codes of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine as it is regarded as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have writing rights (eg. try to copy something into the / usr / share / cd).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting up of & co-audio creator;, something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it for every reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">/ dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for CD-ROM drives; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">There is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, select that you will be informed when information on creating key words (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The flashcard CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading of the & CD; it must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag entry, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & node; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">If you want to enter the database first, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection boxes need to be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb servers over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this path, the load is distributed between the hosts, but this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 8080 protocol, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transmit data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check out this to check out the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if only space on another drive is present. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything in the way it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in the event of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of concurrent WAV files at the same time: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tempted to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD is running. we will create and set up MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and want to fetch data from the freedb. the process described in this section must be repeated for every reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look slightly different from the data fetched for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; to manually insert data instead of picking them out of the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, go to the Questions and Answers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully fetched by the freedb, all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives, a window will be displayed, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'current title' field, the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered into the 'Actual Title' field, unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments inidividually per piece, the commentary field of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with upper case letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 notes for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & the audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all the encoding or file formats. see the help file for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the exited CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK', go back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the button All the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder is not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: order 4 is encoding of part 1 to MP3 format. this makes reading and coding concurrently. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. if machines are weak, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the codec of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; part of an important & node; package. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variations in settings. the best way to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue how it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who reads this has probably started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot keep this manual. it is the first version for a manual on & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it. at least only after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing to this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you succeeded in getting the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player from & kde; beside others, it has with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. Alsa will be involved as soon as there is a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the keys pressed on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag and drop every MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically calculates the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish & scratch; when playing a song, kmid will start the next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry Abplay from the Edit menu or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you pull it onto the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played sequentially.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once you play a piece, you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and starting with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template to change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item Pause in the Edit menu, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song lyrics and another both. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song uses, so that you don't have to manually set the record. however, if you select the entry Automatic text choice in the Settings menu, you will automatically choose the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI Files that you summarize. these will be played in the series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can select the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears in the File dialog, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will be added automatically to the active collection when opened (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically added to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu subscription sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the next song, the next song from the Edit menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song back, select the button Prey piece, the entry Previous item from the Edit menu or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that transforms all of the Change patch to Bright Piano events into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally played a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you must edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all the required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap... END Define Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will see how the patches of General MIDI will be mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 tools.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to record all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a bullet (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), similar to a rifle shot. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (rifle), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the word drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound represents a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is their presence.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and tool. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map notes on the percussions channel. for example, take a look at the provided key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, you will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. thus, if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that receives a pitch-bender event will play with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find them in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list, where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the item Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, and so on. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to fix the problem you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow keys on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & node; desktop a & konqueror; windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; move windows and drag the desired file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.DLL. first, you only want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, this animates me, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrostr.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. currently I am in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antarrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They really make me happy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact with friends of & kmid; but if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and didn't get any money from anybody. I would like to emphasize that I am only more programmed because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, bug notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also goes to all these outstanding musicians on the web, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view pictures. you will also find links to pages with additional karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends much on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, compile & kmid; compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE site on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made up of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can only be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. just click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if you leave the edit mode or select another group without the same playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / Wonder.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing for the end animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; Mlt; & lt; img dur = "inappropriate" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; / mum.gif; & lt; / mum.gif; & lt; / mum.gif; & lt; / mum.gif; & lt; / mum.gif.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything has to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, just like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even be added to the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignment of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. the started process is called pop player. if there are no errors here, the backend issue is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon will reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can be played by TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this takes kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device to be used and the TV channels must be used. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be found under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found out (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvd source, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrones.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints as to how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command can be run as root after connecting the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for its performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1747">If you have any questions or if you wish to compile & edit, please contact the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, direct and custom access to all & latex; programs. finally, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; -Reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & posters; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a Lay (lay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While only a good review of & latex is given, it is not the ultimate book about it. to master & latex; good books, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\} class, the body starts with the command\\ start {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard from & Kile; is a useful feature for the fast creation of a document in & box; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some possibilities for creating the document. there may also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is the type of document to be created: articles (article), book [book], articles (DIN), Article (DIN) [scrtprt], book (DIN) [scrbook], projectors [beamer], films [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this will set the character encoding. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used extra packages for & latex; for the integration, they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), Report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about this. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Automatically complete the environment when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically generates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to lock the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the menu Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to be divided into the following elements (the highest and subsection is the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; file recovery can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [device independent file]] is created, jumps & kicks; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the external output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are plucked with the editor, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file was clicked, the exact opposite of this is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, there is a jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is mounted on the incessant, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick build.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large-scale multiple selection fields should be followed. the selection fields have been developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the fast structure of the document into parts, chapters, sections... The available & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field further is for inserting items such as tags, notes notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Description: this command creates a name for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"" "reference: used for reference to a specified term (select a selection box)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ ffe is used for determining the font size. it can be specified to specify the font size for the main text, the marks, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12 pt] defines the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the code sample above has to be entered, the & latex; source code needs to be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the quick build button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved prior to compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging. when using quick build & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font e 12 will be created and a different font should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} is intended to allow to change the font in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only secured inside the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat, italics, submissions etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the intensive print and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be shown in italics with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language is now followed by a step-by-step guide to creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a little text has been entered in the wizard, a few modifications should be made for the better readability of the document. this should be a quotation, a few points in the bold and italics print and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (for internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a standard file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi issues such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF conversion or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, only Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... Tools construction will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on to preview search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; file and corresponding line. for this you need to set & box; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (Setup suite... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using the & DVI connection, a fault can be found. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the log file respectively in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file records the source of errors in the source text. in the editor, the pop-up Previous LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors can be used for syringes. in order to view the incorrect line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logging and & kip; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting Empty document, a document can either be rewritten from the ground or used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclasses [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and carried through the steps described above.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & posters; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and highlighting many different kinds of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate; and his possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference, which can be called over the MenÃ ¼ Support LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on the\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source code and highlight them. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is a special type of bookmark inside the text. the MenÃ ¤ger Edit jump stamps or the corresponding keystrokes allow the jump to the next or last jump mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile;. although it offers excellent opportunities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code has been added; special commands for their selection. under Edit select the following commands for text selection include:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only preventative thing in & box; is that the gaps are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also displays & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example, a part of the document can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Placards; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for more commands under the Edit environment for a possible basic work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command terminates the recently opened environment so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups determined by brackets {...}. under the Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command you jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the scented clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the scented bracket of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested welded groups-parentheses quickly the overview can be lost. this command completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as hallmarks. for the appropriate implementation, the character is used in & Kile; the character is used for two simple quotes.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double quote characters can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There may also be specific settings (e.g. German or French) and thus German or French application signs. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift; Access button for & Kile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">In a table environment t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with an attached line breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to assign columns in tables -environments and all Et characters (amp;) among each other. when using Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the next tabulator in the underlying line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, it was added in & Kile; there are several modes built in. three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic finishing. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Kile... Complete setup.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list will be removed. on the other hand, the list can be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command. alternatively, a jump to these positions is possible with the Edit jump-mark NÃ ¤chste Jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Complete you can make adjustments to these lists. there can be different directory lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wipers of the general language use are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for completing environments. a few letters with\\ begin must always be entered and the execution mode call will result in a large e-list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When activating the complete area or pressing Alt + Shift-key Alt + Shift-key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is complete, the environment is automatically closed again. once you see that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Too; Complete you can make adjustments to these lists. this mode uses the complete list of complete set-up mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of derivatives, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile Comprehensive. as an example of a caching list, the file example.cwl, for example, is included in the L =\\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the MenÃ ¼ Edit Translation or key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the character L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large e WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher is not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many WÃ ¶ rters in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the complete registration for all already written approval.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu item Kile... Take off boxes. here, also the threshold value for the display of completion can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The executing files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nliche home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (directory) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics make the entry of graphics as simple as possible. for the inspection of the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and re-orders of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then be converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the creation compiling, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the further transformation may be the key element Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard-faced viewer by means of Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt; 5 the PS file can be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick-build command, a viewer is normally called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, each time a new window will open.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be added to the Project New Project.... for this purpose the following information is requested for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kiprr project file.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button Setze as presses. the currently selected member (their identities) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of your team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information on team leaders when something specific happens. see in for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be showing the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta... This dialogue extends over some pages that are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags, including code completion, can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means that the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if attached, tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Exclude optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags, except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end date: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic set-up of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default setting can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than file opening files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is stocked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting will be stocked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; periodically creates backup copies, so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings for the next start is useful when the user interface is perverted by changing MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetschematic command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings, the visibility of knots in the tree can be set automatically. empty nodes are empty areas in the text while empty groups are such where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The section for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that can be unfolded when editing an extensive text. abbreviations are in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications of third-hand, which can be re-used by any part-enabled application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not located at a stationary like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only mode" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only Lese-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select allows saving the entry also if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the dbg Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the options next to the debugger plugin drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view shown in the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if required, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to DebugGen sitting starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the View Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debug request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script, with error-adjusted if possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there was no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adapt & quantaplus; to adapt to your needs and how you can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type edit packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for market and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; features such as autocomplete and node space. their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag tool bars are handy, symbol-oriented kolodges of picture buttons (above the editing window), insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details about the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, A & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the tag dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but only element type about itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the class class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to each other tag. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only exist once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a break-break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is above in & quantaplus; start the dialog and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following, an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "option" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor available via DTD processing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = turn 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created by setting actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key symbol assigned to this action. by clicking on the user-defined button a shortcut can be assigned; with Kone the current shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted a text in the Detailiated settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way, you can find the script in the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process only. if from & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be rerouted. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the standard output; error messages, directed to the standard error output. it can be specified, what is to be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a custom toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the cup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, enable "Edit Tag" dialog if available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly icon. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the icon created not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regards to the tag start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green, usually as los, start, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is & lt; Start; tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it still needs to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared by some dividers into several groups. open the tool bar to set dialog on Settings tool bar. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (at the top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick access to the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the correct folder. after NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) if a file is opened by the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it out yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc and go to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places, there is an E-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for what it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have several keys, you can choose one. in the New Resources dialog, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbars, and start from the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines and quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a notification appears with the indication of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there's the easiest way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should be published</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, adds & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; it stores all that is selected globally in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to tool lists with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoggles the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the EditorWindow, the tree views, the dividers with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the editor area lead to another context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, when the string under the mouse-pointer refers to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of the editor, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; PGT; then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information on & quantaplus; navigate, open it and roam. in the presentation with flashers stand for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that makes & quantaplus; provides. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of a right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category hangs from the & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the relevant user and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by right-click of an element, a list of commands in reference to navigation and refresher of the tree is opened.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it you can change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned to the content allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on how to find web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two dividers at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are some) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive extended and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar-Archive over & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can save them in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & node; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be kept that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & node; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why development, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & node; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. through the program Commander, they can increase the automation of almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details see help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help _ helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there included special characters to & HTML; description, so they are displayed correctly and not be misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard into & URL; description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Extension and turn on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Open an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; -Projects will be saved with the file extension .webzprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & node; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. it only creates the name. actions need to be set by settings actions... are saved. tool bars are stored by tool bar toolbars, or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; that made you or someone else and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be refreshed from the & DTEP, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu item, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smart insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting using toolbar denied when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemas depends on the billboards; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that matches the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in accordance with the context of the mouse-pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name the file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webzprj (e.g. foo.webzprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be attached when files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clip out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. you can upload these settings in the menu with project properties in the menu-tree in the subwindow profile or shift with the Shift; F7 shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are re-read in project-related operations, such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, including files listed in .cvsignature, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded when the project is opened. you can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed supports. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload profiles can be uploaded (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by adding an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the Event configuration subwindow you can switch event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-specified event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you cannot influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows selecting a project. projects have .webzprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will happen. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are also active, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten during the program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your shortwave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in one project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via the tool toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to one's own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars are in & quantaplus; the best way to design toolbars is to use and add. the addition of toolbars will be handled at the bottom of the add toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which new action, a New toolbar can be created, it can remove other actions like tool bar, rename toolbars, or set tool bars, where can be specified which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a tool bar, the entries will be removed and action processed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up tool keys in the menu... and set Settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; basically uses templates such as a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents are made in appropriate subfolders. a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in an appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File Save As Template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Save As Template Save Selection as Local / Project Template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used to use all file management functions, such as dragging and inserting or inserting the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project file tree view, select a name for the template and back up. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can specify headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, paste or associate with them. additionally, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / app and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / Notes / Quanta / Sheets.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set a folder's behavior, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as elterable attributes are attached.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template table. if a root folder would be set in this way, it would disable templates in this path, except they would be explicitly enabled. in the event of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or completed text for templates in this folder. this might be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows by copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip an entire presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached through the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source editor by the VPL; editor and second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the default of the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 mode activates the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor is configurable via Settings Quanta. depending on the choice of VPL; View can be selected between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small split for fast computers and a large apot for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows editing invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; Editor is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is possible as in a word processor, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted through typing and dropped by means of a button or removed button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables wizard or the lists assistant are disabled. later, they will work in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of style templates. in contrast to other programs for style sheets, searching for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To successfully compile & xsldbg, you need the libxslt, libexslt and LibXML libraries, which are already present in a typical installation of & node.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Halt in a template, in a place loaded by xsldbg loaded style or xml file or at the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, orphaned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg retrieves the full path from a filename without path. file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file names with relative path to the con xsldbg file folder. for example, a style template file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl is possible:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor under the differences windows allows resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both distinguish files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are located in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by only writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 1 folder, folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will remember your selection and display it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">On the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, a folder then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field for the target is active and can be processed. however, it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file immediately. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Insert button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to move text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present you can't remove anything from scratch. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any information line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the Comprehensive column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line of broken lines is scored.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording issue:, the filename and [Changing] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in any mark you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, side, beginning, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the Paste button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Outward / Ctrl-Picture Outward) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the tag to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the clipboard and manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option because you might accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line End files are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + newline\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start. (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides variable width fonts, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be displayed straightened. on these systems the button presets automatically introduces an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tab button is pressed. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, you try to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step is compared to each line. in this step, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\' at the end of a line, others only save a line feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the cart return character, but then files may be disabled with different sizes in page-to-page comparison, but then this option may be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically advanced mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to restart and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a quick note appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII) with this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress any changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; & gt; C is displayed next to the normal one and a second oversight column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply shutdown the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes view the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. together, a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly matches your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the entry into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\ 1 / 'This. * is a superscript that matches all characters in a row. the\\ 1 converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generating text $. now, a pre-processing command for line abnormalities is required.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Realization / SCHALTER 'However, perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the index-algorythm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes without actually carrying out it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you have to select the corresponding menu entry or press F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed by a small message about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were compared to that time will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions flaps All subdirectories and flaps up all subdirectories with which you can open up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. for folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirtff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option is synchronized directories. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after merging; B nach A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the new file is selected instead of merge (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file will work after the other. the status column displays Fertig when merging was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the combined actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C is used as a destination, in the two-folder merge, B is selected as the target and when syncing A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merge / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to create only the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. they can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with options passing, simulating and abrupting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the actual changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (to merge a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, restart / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, then a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When you run the merge (F7 key), a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder-specific can be set with a .cvindication file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems files have a hide attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that if the option is enabled, the links will lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and essentially slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders to a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when copying the change date. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge is provided that the other file was not changed too.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted, the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .original. if an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible while merging single files; you can switch the window divider to the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn off the Windows menu main window and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently known as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. first, KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDec3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview - KDiff3Part from the pop-up menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as Part executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now there are compare) are already available. in addition, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by scripting in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or who are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources and probably not told the configure script to the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly halted; No src is left; and the text cannot be deleted. what does it mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & node, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no problems while compiling. if you encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-paste) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will likely change in a later version of the program.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when you click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual working areas. it's quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, exit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager. movement is possible both within a working surface and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries pager. clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and end. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, the names of the virtual working surfaces are displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field indicates the & Kpager; displaying the numbers of the virtual worktops. if it is crossed together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems only.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & pager; -main window can be determined: classically, & pager; in a 2xN grid, all virtual working surfaces appear horizontally and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then select switch settings... allow the dialog settings to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can manually do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice versa. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must register as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse-pointer persists for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click brings pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that occurs when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, you may also feel pain caused by the use of your computer. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool, avoid pain while clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse, and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shifting activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it has emulated the mouse button. move the mouse, wait it until the end of the mouse button. in this way, you can execute the pulling with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must be clogged after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent shifting is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool, waits after the mouse button down before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; supports now clicking through mouse shift. if this function activates, creates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ estkes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider set sound buffer that you tune to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the button, the settings are reset to the state after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be switched off first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times from & node; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of where a mouse click is left without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not constitute a link does not lead to undesired reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent shifting in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can do a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool, continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it. however, park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want a keyboard input. thus, a accidental moving of the mouse can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to highlight text, copy it to clipboard or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shifting if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this time, whenever & kmousetool, the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when intelligent shifting begins the shift time. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor resides. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a drawing process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping using the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you get from the flashcard orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reads this, this output will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as to & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character sets replace parts of a text by other text. the pieces to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktats; is provided with pre-defined string player filters, which enable the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & contexts; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of supply of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice on the cartridge card speaker, you can read text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text continues to be passed on to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a notification, warning or a & kde; Notification is sent to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom of the page. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed in the series from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and it will display the following setup dialogs below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up character-chain replacement filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Ersetzen. the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The character-chain replacement filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filters when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the character-chain replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited by delimiters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the cequitils package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is available through the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the dialup selection filter, you can send texts to a particular speaker set up on the card speaker or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & when a text is handed over to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that the program sends, which sends the text to & ktts; the speaker will be able to override the selected speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the above filter conditions, the speaker is selected, which is most likely to meet the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialog box selection.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; it enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; Package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf to show the device at all and allow the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed in the installation of & linux; installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the Network Setting, this option attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the choice is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and release date. by checking the settings no-re-questions, the definition can be determined durably.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. by clicking the button System Administration Mode, you get to the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three Reiter:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to set up in the Dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Selecting Manuell can be done without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. switching on a switched-off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers only understand IP addresses. if the host asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed or changed. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons down or downright in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group host to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The Nameless Well-known calculator describes the name-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of Named hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known machine from the list and select Edit.... Edit Calculate Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module's network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & console; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient when & kde; and Qt is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.conf. the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, and in the second section all of the configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is given.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never been widely distributed, and IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at the & eg; Workplace, the network administrator can use the contact point, which is a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can not simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf are located and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections so it will not be surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is truncated by the scripts in SuSE config. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which moreover provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated from & kdat. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat, trains the band back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; the pre-tensioning on the tape does not, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">If this is not found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched through the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to ejection of the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; shows by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band from & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandpass must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat. this process requires that a tape can be formatted before use. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat, proceed with the format of the tape. all the data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Safe menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog, you can even check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it only checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the verification process has been started, the dialog appears settings for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears to Check. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that should be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or the subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog for Restore appears. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">This dialog shows the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile based on the content of the band. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rewrite the index to two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it will be backed up, located on the same filesystem as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems, can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the other files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is integrated the command is loaded to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to block the ejection from the tape drive. it may not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when resolving the integration of & kdat, the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option turned on, trying & kdat; the hardware-based block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat - in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only record a block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this icon is only active when a tape is included.</seg>

<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog, first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. if you do not see it, and it opens a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or after input strings. the list of the log lines is now changed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed. then a protocol line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. in addition, in the protocol file system log, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. note lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of the level indication. the colored description of protocol lines can be switched off alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example, in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use Filterstrip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "in addition, you can activate the" "" "Add new lines" "" "option in the main window context menu to view all the new added protocol lines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log message from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & node; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as so) as & ksysv; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init system is rapidly becoming standard for controlling program start-up in the & Linux system; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V init without making a new installation and re-formatting. the Linux kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to run when you boot the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d when you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use of it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something while driving, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; I could also have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runtime to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runners or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will not remove the entry from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you remove an entry from the domain of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore items thrown in the recycle bin, so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've experimented with the standard round leveln and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) just terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly configured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adjustment of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have enabled advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unxes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The file password management will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This flashcard appears only if for at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field filesystem with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups menu provides information about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group belonging to the user can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
