although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interests .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sorry love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so nicely .
he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won during Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party has ever attained .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ al@@ is@@ mus@@ h program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ ump Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not to agree with the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
m@@ umps intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who beha@@ ved like their son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump paved his way to nom@@ ine@@ e Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things broke my heart almost .
perhaps it is unfair to call the plat@@ former voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account in the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . ) : as much as &quot; white against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; word@@ play from white in allu@@ sions to the Wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones mentioned , has killed exactly what America did so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ ite , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white America gives this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
at all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he got a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country for whom his son fell , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the message said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them .
a school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always arrive laugh@@ ingly and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an &apos;s capital - are based on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ conditioned instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them don &apos;t live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had been shown something he never saw before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication is within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already started illegal fishing in the territory of Liberia , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and not inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles immediately mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to run one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded by F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries which then expelled the prime ministers from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and interact with each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystem that has a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and circul@@ ated by the slu@@ g emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , for example , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas . such susp@@ icious driving routes can also be discovered , such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such studies can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy company advoc@@ ating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales that the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen arriving in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
its practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licence documents , imag@@ inations , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ gaps organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , the Global Fishing Watch platform , together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization , has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite information and can be displayed globally by the position of each tracking vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and have hardly expected consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped det@@ ecting Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now other countries are now copying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces with the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Safety is the aim of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be produced in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member land Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under the wrong flag . and not only was the ship travelling without licence and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they used a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ ain@@ ing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are deemed to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inc@@ it@@ ement of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on inaugur@@ ation , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , whose eyes closed the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , re@@ acted by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the restoration of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ operating at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum has been considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called on the proceedings against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , were scheduled to continue on November 3rd .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it &apos;s so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an cries out . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which depic@@ ts the extent of repression per day :
in this way , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your official release !
on the road !
others see these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , out of its point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and is rather busy making critical voices silent .
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities committed in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department at La Per@@ la in 1976 until 1978 .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .

when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP .
bear in mind that they don &apos;t lead you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I &apos;d become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go off . he led me to a barracks where cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were turned off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I went in and saw a couch that people were tortured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they seldom found a man with cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it over with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty no@@ od@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye ties .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay with their face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people sit quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were called offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process , said the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military even later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you take away from an enemy you fought against .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded from anger , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and move you on your own hands .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar swe@@ ater of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay the burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel repentance .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why should the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ nap your children ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they would have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why should their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court imposed lifel@@ ong sentences and in nine cases sentences of sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were no obj@@ ections .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants originally died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm &apos;s verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and transferred to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ gment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial site that is now being led by human rights organizations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a Kyoto centre in which you can pro@@ long your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , witnessed a very mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n &apos;s daily newspaper , Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the defective English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News explained a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved nationwide in accidents , but quite a reason for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors accounted for 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named Re@@ porter provided comments to the light that show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers :
the article on the translation error has received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So badly the translation is actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to transfer active language skills to translate it into target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost estim@@ ating or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations available in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later on , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online channels also handed over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped and recommended to use the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ ith : enables your VPN to be activated .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again closed .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay offers are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures , if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible via a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its sessions .
earlier investigations by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNA . this is a technique through which the DNS server answers certain domains correctly .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds to errors or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6th April when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody .
Fl@@ ores was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that the Cri@@ mean is ino@@ cul@@ ated guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family , who in the belief that they complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl gets mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín returned to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent put@@ ts . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra moved on to Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered a fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no more Carolina &quot; to be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; lam@@ ented Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children without imp@@ unity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pioneering - for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go occurs in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Job@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the time and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house@@ wife &apos;s library than food from the fridge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would meet again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the ad once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .

social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , altered by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rules on usage and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be created which is in charge of granting citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and cur@@ ses in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technical ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful monitoring system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no dissi@@ dent nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of Leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the free wilderness is small and goes against zero . therefore , when the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera @-@ hall , Raz@@ a breaks out pure joy .
as a qualified bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to establishing protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast that had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was still experiencing a nuclear accident , so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( all @-@ in @-@ one @-@ drive , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned new homes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent of the final light .
however , six years after the catastrophe , they still endeav@@ our to reloc@@ ate ev@@ acu@@ ated housing shel@@ ters ( all @-@ in @-@ one , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
nearly 40 percent of Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of those ev@@ acu@@ ated after disaster in homes were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of the work and daily life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper could as@@ certain , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away from here again .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants make it more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and how her ou@@ trage against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk changed .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done .
what about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma did not only have to witness the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand , there are still some 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees are older than 50 years old . they fail to return to correct dwell@@ ings because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one meets people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has consolidated her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer took him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer attacking with a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás admitted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly rush to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated $ 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be brave , Matthew . &quot; &quot; &quot;
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared multiple times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he under@@ took the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here was the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a bat@@ on .
police violations
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police missions on demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police deployed protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas .
the MEP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to rel@@ inqu@@ ish violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media covered street protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo immediately reported a broken glass window to display their titles illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot;
villages forgotten by the de@@ priv@@ ation of Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane mills .
after the replacement the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and yo@@ d@@ elling daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; veter@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who stands up at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he heard that there were sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which were in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alled exactly that I would get the sugar cane factory in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , but the promise wasn &apos;t kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the location to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first anniversary , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would be distinguished only in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they were generating in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of those present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to im@@ itate , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they were to be replaced .
without prospects of the future , many young people also left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the congregation .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene walks in retirement at the age of 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bit@@ tern@@ ess .

as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop concludes that the young participants explore topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are an inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mar@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West kan@@ ada , on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also go ahead with our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic courts ( all @-@ inclusive ) outside a typical Japanese restaurant .

in Japan , one can see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin San@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; Plastic Models of Cour@@ ts &quot; ) are issued by each dish served in this restaurant .
customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ sho@@ oter district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile devices and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger found it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin San@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone straps decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food orders is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic .
some mobile phone support and mobile designer will allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ic@@ ura and salmon che@@ ats are used , a popular opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # with the in @-@ and @-@ line @-@ drive .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed periodi@@ cally only appear in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , imp@@ elled the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug trafficking &quot; ) , which is intended to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and anti@@ trust authorities .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the impact is far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who seeks secret graves every weekend to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have placed , and to search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they do not receive them , because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader by Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
the in@@ fu@@ tili@@ ty of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being &quot; wat@@ ery . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and are silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as they do not know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of age .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood came to an end .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizen council for public security and the government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 murder . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings a day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Ap@@ point@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 whose aim is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages linked to it include images showing violence .
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial release it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to this .
officials described a fire@@ ball rolling up dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses spra@@ yed and cor@@ p@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to obli@@ vi@@ on .
a picture with the title &quot; That &apos;s Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ gu@@ r user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gre@@ y@@ ish scenes of that day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of lost bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been cut , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated visually .
the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from DR Congo again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented orders on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously bring about the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who fle@@ eing could flee , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following arose which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein has said , monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to capture this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an His testimony , but had not linked the picture from DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of this false dec@@ ou@@ pling extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are indeed coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they originate from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have convey@@ ed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries , based on what they have been published on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have also been linked together in some cases ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the orange card ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country studies of false cou@@ plings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

true or false ? ) .
one side of the rum@@ ours was that the said photograph shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only identifies the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the individuals and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in Nord @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the village .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am as this one , who used the picture from DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster have seen that dispro@@ ve this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the fla@@ wed use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , at that time promoted by a post of American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

this article draws attention to the continuing poverty of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar but quoted the work of an Indian Express article with the image taken from DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express did not contain this picture at the time of the publication of our contribution .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; the world of art is just more useful than ever before !

this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek Fak@@ ten@@ check page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims over the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used illustr@@ ative the picture of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news to his side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the picture from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia provides two extreme examples of an impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the claims made by Roh@@ ing@@ ya because the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a resolution on what they came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately resour@@ ceful news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which was exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors who are operating H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein agreed to be in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been murdered by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital published now , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it portra@@ ys a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to dispro@@ ve that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo pu@@ zz@@ led with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was taken as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages related there@@ to were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the embassy in which the picture from DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also pointing but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the image may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sen@@ timent of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it taste the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can also be used detached from the context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. conf@@ using ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Van@@ u@@ atu @-@ cla@@ p language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; inv@@ alu@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite villages here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement from the disaster relief centre in Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge @-@ waves .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe locations .
the rain@@ falls started on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
floods in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the magnitude of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal floods wor@@ sen the crisis of the Den@@ gue fever , Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ all is on its way .
today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents of their flooded villages .
several organisations and start @-@ ups have also decided to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka supply important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ needed goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Pick@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the App in order to inform the cat@@ ast@@ ers centre .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and Sri Lanka &apos;s civilian population , where several social media platforms are fully utili@@ sed , bring residents in need of security and help remedi@@ al measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March will be held in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .

in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust her my four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , we are launching rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head towel high , bound from an American flag , others cann@@ y slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
they are un@@ le@@ asing me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in there , be ab@@ domin@@ ated .
ab@@ domin@@ als are being m@@ apped
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to shift them .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States did not even vote for their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head towel in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both sides of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother presented her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a sore Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ held hand@@ bag , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks , and mis@@ information experts who have manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head towel .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms , and gave her the Arab verses to the protection that will seal the Koran and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim part is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother on my mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they win a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi years ago .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslims means speaking the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is the way they taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over the centuries - has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; which has founded a company named Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept sore for his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
being Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb in history was dropped over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ an under@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled in more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion are deeply rooted in our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread across the continent except Antar@@ cti@@ ca , had gone to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ul@@ fs the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , called Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple links , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that closes its borders against people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we reject to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous forms of expression that we are ste@@ aling in our news coverage .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to prolifer@@ ate Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ H , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet been given ; now they are ruling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me become an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things that I have left here like a bread cro@@ oked track in my speech .
things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public mind , were self @-@ employed at Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he is already bombar@@ ded by broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been organising events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be heard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers start their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story @-@ t@@ eller , their devotion and their representation result in the audience re@@ viewing .
they call forth laughter and emotion , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this turn , stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ata takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand it . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story telling .
Puerto Rico claims to re@@ inst@@ ate state debt by the US
with the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march launched at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the Austrian Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly of Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to the remun@@ eration that operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to settle down with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , imposed measures will risk being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Watch for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture aimed at Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Sur@@ inquiry ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book aims to discuss how movements are built up for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with this .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison since March 2012 in Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bass@@ el took on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and made note of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently out@@ going director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prot@@ otyp@@ ing was more for@@ e@@ ward than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this journey into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el wasn &apos;t able to finish this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in custody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ filed she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for one year together in the book .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the thr@@ ong of prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

one year passes , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , until 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , along with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment on account of the mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800@@ ,000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not promise the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) , condemned the company &apos;s decision to address the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP .
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary action against the infrin@@ gement .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; contrary &quot; :
if Cam@@ bri@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison term and half of which had settled .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
it &apos;s a contradiction !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ ale :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the moral to return and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself by the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only for ever being the first independent president to be remembered , but also as sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he for@@ c@@ efully confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down for 10 years and was free .
and today the company , at which he de@@ file funds , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ λ@@ Sob@@ oul ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
in fact , in # Mos@@ ambique th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ imo to be , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long @-@ term imprisonment , returns to # airports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as ad@@ j@@ ectives &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all @-@ in @-@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt in order to express their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( split@@ ters ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n play .
the sentence ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( split@@ ting b@@ sen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech will get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete , post and share content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also fuel the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the balancing hate speeches on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather in context as initiatives focused on code and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the mono@@ gam@@ y is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law which should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at aboli@@ shing the laws of children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
but not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft law .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one on the other .
after having previously voted in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who mour@@ ns a minist@@ erial commission in the ministry of education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the Act has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
follow Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age @-@ old age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft amend@@ ment was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Chr@@ y@@ ag@@ ei@@ s@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj proc@@ la@@ ims his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed and he seems to replace his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi argued that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate about the subject would go differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking so general , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure if we , instead of addressing the problem , would simply say that the state , our daughters before protects them , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in charge of them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage in different levels is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

thanks to the mirr@@ oring of web pages , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia &apos;s content

for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking .
although many technically experienced Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all of the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine host connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , in spite of the legal prohibition , but accessible .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after having listened to the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all the sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors , when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how he helped him achieve this first @-@ class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida &apos;s Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a leop@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already standing face to face with tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ zz@@ ler appeared . he immediately goes , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women , with the greatest care , avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with names .
the tradition of their wives also do not name their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far less ad@@ mitt@@ ance to fear , if at all , they should not come back to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers as well as house@@ wives , entered a unique club and became the main social theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the disclosure of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected people , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round dealt with women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak out loud , is a custom that they are all du@@ bi@@ ous and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name so far , wanted to try at home at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she had just chu@@ ck@@ led before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the full fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they held their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ c@@ amber point on the forehead that marks the marriage status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped carrying him .
the other women have not stopped altogether , but they think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves , not to carry it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what they could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , such as our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they are .
in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to create it .
the question as to whether in the five months since its first discussion club had already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to tell the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on 29th June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their esteem for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed Beat@@ les 1964 in London , re@@ marked in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! and today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . we were here in Tokyo for the first time , 51 years ago .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pupp@@ et is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how the day is going on today .
so , we hope you are here !

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trafficking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a glorious man could bring gold or bring wealth , the polic@@ eman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia told the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of kill@@ ings for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique under Mos@@ ambique are aiming for ritual attacks , warned the Mozambique polic@@ emen following the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair fall problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icles of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ na@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties faced by Mozambique :
I am ashamed of a country where people would have been ashamed to demand sex against good marks , work and other accompli@@ sh@@ ments , a nation in which people would rever@@ t honest occup@@ ations and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mah@@ ado , Human Rights Watch scientist and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
Mos@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of bald people .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Foreign Ministry in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokesman said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him to treat abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about his release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the export of salmon to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she announced in a declaration on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they are supposed to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he helped him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy prompted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere with China &apos;s internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great qual@@ ms if the fuss around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada , Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be surrounded by his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um further tells :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
France &apos;s foreign ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o ob@@ tains all treatments he needs , regardless of where he is needed . furthermore his wife and his family are supposed to have contact with him .
although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information if France would eventually receive it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with a declaration on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would lead to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this statement spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ ary exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , considering that , it seemed inevitably un@@ democratic .
however , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam put answers to his American guests regarding our press , our dict@@ at@@ orial , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he could answer corresponding questions ration@@ ally with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out critics concerning the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as leader of an adol@@ escent generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - either I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is right and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam put &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mistake or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , will we only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ ans make their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , tends to be a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be presented .
the latest part of this series was written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly rage if they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans take a Canadian flag on their back@@ pack when they travel .
they all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would switch me to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ it@@ ous - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a principal characteristic of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we lack the warm@@ hearted , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau comp@@ iles the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ od@@ les Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band fam@@ ed in Thailand has released a music video depicting the Jun@@ ta who seized power in 2014 and , in spite of their promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what regulations he makes his girlfriend .
although not explicitly political , the music video indirectly refers to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which grants absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Change Change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered as critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest campaig@@ ners and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( majority insul@@ t ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems which the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the teas@@ ers of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post@@ war society re@@ covers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ Ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an War officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ Ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , ab@@ as@@ ants , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
more than 10,000 people lived here during the pre @-@ war period ; today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ Ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area in 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where clothes are dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother banned us from being photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it &apos;s difficult to get across the rounds .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia Minor , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could grow zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation turns towards the end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children tracks the ball now .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
it is rather quiet at the moment , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medications that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a beard go@@ at@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ en travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests send her often text messages when she went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l de sa@@ c leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money out of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him a roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travellers constantly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her house full , but she &apos;s also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with lots of photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens she has made a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang from t@@ witter users in a timely manner .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in announ@@ cing the police , the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; malicious information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend on @-@ line and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , crowded , ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( full @-@ screen ) that published cens@@ ored news in China showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the occup@@ ants random@@ ly if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can unlock the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office at the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole range of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; series in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything you need is gone .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all honor to its name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death .
all doubt dissolve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of the un@@ holy . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone erected around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest , like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods desired , only my own .
for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stuffed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down a bit after the power supply in the neighborhood ceased to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a grand picture that filled my expectations completely and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office , I leave everything I wear with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I detail all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they have assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with just one more prisoner , and I must put myself in immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular comra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called the doctor .
in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time cry the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it &apos;s a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and stub@@ born man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions behind him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will end up soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to make this penalty .
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to pull me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure ; you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or whether that belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity fed my whole body , enough to provide my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lie back to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like a few minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and leave you , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always left me free .
where do they guide me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned its tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria up to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal in the Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the war@@ es speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose , primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries .
it is therefore easy to avoid doing basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the band &apos;s engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , questioning the well @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved traditional sex @-@ storms to Lei@@ be by indul@@ ging in his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently laid down unknown woman whose arms and legs extend to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary Pri@@ mor@@ ants &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crime against crime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Act of 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from themes that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was informed of politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse repe@@ ats itself notably :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments were torn from context , distorted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not contrary to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ a , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ova , who later should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ to@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason that they have critically commented on the issues related to the corruption in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan did not prevent M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream about bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region is approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and arti@@ fici@@ ally produced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time comes , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to its knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breath @-@ taking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ u@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

it is rare that external appearances and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youths from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street and illegal drugs trade are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences growing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens are entering the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair sty@@ ling tools and to obtain a training in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a career that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year that started in March and reported some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to meet people who feel ej@@ ected ?
the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation was no longer inspired by the Young Youth Foundation &apos;s campaign and inspired them to write letters to reconciliation , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sign@@ atory of the Peace Treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would close together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day : inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace . &quot;
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Bo@@ got@@ way Foundation travelled to the camp to personally convey the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of protecting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ ret , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him fully , and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
maybe he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now that peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice done by the State to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated , even people with beautiful feelings turned around with their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , raise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and make sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ va whose first publication was published on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she sen@@ sed that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear about her life , she eventually moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ and@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
at the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which guards were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he was respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that all was a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by running above without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has damaged not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights friends checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought her without regi@@ stering me , without proof , without proof of everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you do not believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are hiding . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have remained dor@@ t@@ ted ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who took in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock out a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not very many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to submit to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were purpos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ards had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken away .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports until now . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to approach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never we@@ aned a hair on me .
in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said that children are funny about the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality in television .
he did not talk about us per se , but rather about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ps , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up the type of refuge .
I am a Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is true .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to show you foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have what the cab@@ ar@@ ins have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different ways of life .
for me it is most important to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 saw the desperate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran dominated by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who would like to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - were hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who , due to the persecution of the Iranian government , were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population has little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youth increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all Fem@@ inists in general .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still per@@ ver@@ ted through the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and three .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on black women , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , which we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of every skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join as a black woman in a movement , in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a men@@ ace and margin@@ alised being in historical proportions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs to drive forward their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was called for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm , I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will be published once again as part of a content sharing agreement .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a repeatedly travelled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Water@@ borne Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ borne Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , bro@@ o@@ ks and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the main focus of her work is on pursued , poorly paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of reference . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s detailed ad also took advantage of nothing .
a few days later , the second woman left her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make an announcement at all , they generally do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement agencies .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and stati@@ stic 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that nothing sub@@ ni@@ v@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate conversion hits and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General issued 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courses . 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements were also shown here .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ stries Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; there are 9 women who do not do so in Paraguay because of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who will not do this for physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that she was supposed to repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she wore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long from Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ill @-@ treated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ tori@@ as ads with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her homeland in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ ici@@ dal to a self @-@ perpet@@ ual crime @-@ continu@@ ance and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the legal text has been changed in a number of ways in order to also win parliam@@ ent@@ arians for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be paved , which is currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original draft plan envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must wear at present , if they just want to submit an ad and obtain a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay mal@@ treatment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators will be punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to pay for such a long time until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is deemed to be a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned Az@@ am@@ n newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Peru@@ vian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he will serve an annual prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially the domestic secret services , the freedom of the press , freedom of the press , and to torture and in@@ timi@@ date human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the arrest of three of its editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a case of succession .
newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties tie hands of justice . &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was charged with the special department from ISS and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , he joined the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3000 om@@ anian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the spread of material that could represent a danger to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ anian Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after a six @-@ month custo@@ dial sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he will serve his imprisonment sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision by the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to rel@@ inqu@@ ish , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of Az@@ am@@ n by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again presented the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in Oman recently the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of print on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ain@@ ment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to :
1 . immediately release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial Sch@@ ik@@ anen .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent States by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi Health System .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be receiving receivers instead of being a film@@ maker .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are making articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents were not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rots . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding salad , but he now needs a longer time since his work is increasingly ham@@ pered by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like there &apos;s a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to d@@ ump@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far for salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of sage , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to make as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds , cross it in order to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow them - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control on seeds and the ability to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which , for example , is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep others available to their seeds free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool , due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted , shr@@ inks inc@@ ess@@ antly .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all car@@ rots characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders either at all or only very difficult to use .
there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specific desirable traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders goes through more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property can restrict other breeders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , it promotes it by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years wait for a patent to run , certainly not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the traits themselves .
the plants form them and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation is needed masses of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , is breeding into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) have patents , most of the smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they refuse the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , it is protected from competition , which makes it quite simple for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
while the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source seed seed program . &quot; to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explained that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it contradic@@ ts the current practice of the European patent law allowing patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a declaration is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa met to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open @-@ source seed seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be planned for the next year .
an association of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has , above all , paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law to reveal the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website block@@ ages fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to the AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
blocking the blo@@ gs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i priority ; and even if the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; a arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities locked websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through the en@@ cro@@ achment of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter contents on which Egyptian users may have access .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the governmental crisis .

day by day newspapers in whole Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second @-@ largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy , and air sea to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper then explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . however , which devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative , so as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t even know the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are 8@@ 43 areas according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against den@@ oun@@ cing violence as a &quot; war . &quot; in her opinion , this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold accoun@@ tability to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown by an extra on the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

according to the statistics of 2015 , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil , &quot; says Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the biggest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit issued by Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police command and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this led to a decrease in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also causing serious consequences for the people .
for this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this involves entering the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ char@@ ted point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
one week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly driven by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed outside Damascus , which led to the need for residents of locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points of smu@@ g@@ gled food .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant it in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , please use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of cultiv@@ ating fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shor@@ tages locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger bath . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have developed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) to obtain new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many areas in Portugal on 21 October and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the North of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two persons died , and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state shower last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in four districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ gos@@ PT
numerous videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the authorities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a l@@ ure of the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
these problems add that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the Jo@@ ão P@@ ina developer in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - perhaps no more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara abandoned the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than himself , in order to earn their living .
back then , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran have been affected by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; recalls A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed food to aid in need twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that due to relatively high ratings , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum , which after the registration of the asylum application can still be applied for months .
until then people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ compromising way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to soon release himself from these conditions .
after several years of construction work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings in the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &quot; success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans run business , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and aim to go back to the country he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are in the end .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws permit dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearing of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , prot@@ esting the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international sn@@ apshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months of successful leg@@ alization on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the ending of a penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law applied by sixty parliamentary members is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce more severe pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a high ranking officer .
under the Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the legislative proposal , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tahrir for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who were demonstrating against the military coup led to the inaugur@@ ation of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in prison for a trial date .
recently his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false burden of inter alia arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted of the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists to hear all @-@ le@@ aked documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , which would assure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption charges against officials am@@ nesty if they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on 21 April at the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the attri@@ bution of his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to show their identity ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration with full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached in conversations within social networks . until now , it is not clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
on these websites are currently websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ Trans ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was closed because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to make a political diff@@ use campaign against Turkey &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is with it , among other things China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop mu@@ ff@@ ling
following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install Backdoor programs encryp@@ ting data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
