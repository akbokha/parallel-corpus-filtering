<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very sorry love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as one says so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won during Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party has ever attained.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalismush program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trump Weltanschauung agreed not to agree with the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who behaved like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump paved his way to nominee Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things broke my heart almost.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the platformer voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account in the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (OB.): as much as "white against all other ethnic groups"; wordplay from white in allusions to the Whites and Whiplash, as the great Van Jones mentioned, has killed exactly what America did so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenite, whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trump, however, a huge part of the white America gives this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he got a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for whom his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "this is now" "" "Trump Land" "", "the message said." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always arrive laughingly and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest landfill site of Asunción in Paraguayan's capital - are based on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reconditioned instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them don't live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had been shown something he never saw before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already started illegal fishing in the territory of Liberia, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and not inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles immediately mobilized against the ship. they refused to run one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused to do," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia, because of looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded by FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries which then expelled the prime ministers from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and interact with each other when it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystem that has a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and circulated by the slug empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, for example, news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious driving routes can also be discovered, such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such studies can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy company advocating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales that the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen arriving in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Its practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licence documents, imaginations, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-gaps organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You may not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authorities for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i is to help FISH-i find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, the Global Fishing Watch platform, together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization, has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite information and can be displayed globally by the position of each tracking vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without a license and have hardly expected consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped detecting Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now other countries are now copying," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we have become a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined forces with the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "Safety is the aim of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be produced in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member land Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship under the wrong flag. and not only was the ship travelling without licence and were used towing nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they used a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are deemed to protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the incitement of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on inauguration, Venezuelans, whose eyes closed the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis, reacted by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the restoration of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland region of Barinas, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and at Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-operating at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum has been considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called on the proceedings against President Nicolás Maduro. "in addition, a 12-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, were scheduled to continue on November 3rd.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round, which depicts the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">In this way, the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was originally published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities committed in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmermaid. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department at La Perla in 1976 until 1978.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator of this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay the burden on what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licence, witnessed a very mischievous translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a shield, the Japanese word" "" "older motorists" "" "was wrongly translated as" "" "awful motorists" "", "which means" "" "older drivers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">Kyoto Shimbun's daily newspaper, Kyoto Shimbun, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the defective English translation was initially removed. the term" "" "terrible motorists" "" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News explained a little more detailed with the phenomenon of" "" "terrible" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers who are involved nationwide in accidents, but quite a reason for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors accounted for 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period.</seg>

<seg id="368">"" "-" "" "Is this (" "" "terrible car" "" ") about not reality?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "-" "" "So badly the translation is actually not, isn't it?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to transfer active language skills to translate it into target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost estimating or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">However, some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations available in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naveed con Libertad" (Free surfing) of IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also handed over recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was snapped and recommended to use the Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenith: enables your VPN to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites Venezuelan providers are again closed.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Vivoplay offers are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report about protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures, if they would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I signed up at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible via a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNA. this is a technique through which the DNS server answers certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds to errors or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6th April when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests to Caracas live, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said," "" "The one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that the Crimean is inoculated guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family, who in the belief that they complete their training, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl gets mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín returned to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent putts. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved on to Marín as long as she suffered a fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for "no more Carolina" to be in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," lamented Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">"" "" "" "without papers, it is much easier to hurt the rights of children without impunity." ""</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be pioneering - for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo occurs in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the time and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to the school.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and curses in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video alignment and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi).</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a state-of-the-art prefectures in Japan's Northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima was still experiencing a nuclear accident, so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (all-in-one-drive, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned new homes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima accounts for 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, six years after the catastrophe, they still endeavour to relocate evacuated housing shelters (all-in-one, casetsu juutaku) to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of Evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of those evacuated after disaster in homes were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of the work and daily life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo paper could ascertain, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened its doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have been affected extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far away from here again.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants make it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and how her outrage against the tsunami risk changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the Evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to witness the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still some 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the Evacuees are older than 50 years old. they fail to return to correct dwellings because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one meets people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We talk to five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a migration has consolidated her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>

<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás admitted that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers how he strikes in Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado is calling for further attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, because he undertook the Occupy movement in secondary schools, and here was the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a baton.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police violations</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police missions on demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police deployed protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for speakers, rubber floors and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MEP, Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to relinquish violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media covered street protests by directing the focus on another, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo immediately reported a broken glass window to display their titles illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo favored a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken windshield than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too the term "vandalism" gets absurd, disproportionate importance, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Villages forgotten by the deprivation of Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba joined the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the replacement the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and yodelling daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"" "Nene, a soldier" "" "veteran" "", "who stands up at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep." ""</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there were sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which were in operation after a long inactive period because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalled exactly that I would get the sugar cane factory in Mañalich, but the promise wasn't kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugarcane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavander." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the location to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first anniversary, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that would be distinguished only in terms of the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was surpassed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workstation was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they were generating in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the former president looked into the eyes of those present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to imitate, they also stopped to asphalting the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to pick up other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without prospects of the future, many young people also left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production does not even serve to supply the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop concludes that the young participants explore topics like "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are an inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsummarum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in West kanada, on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also go ahead with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contributes and adds the verse in syllable (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin Sanpuru (the "Plastic Models of Courts") are issued by each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokishooter district Kappabashi there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic meals are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile devices and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the blogger found itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin Sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone straps decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food orders is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an emperor-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designer will allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, icura and salmon cheats are used, a popular opping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # with the in-and-line-drive.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed periodically only appear in statistics, but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, impelled the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which is intended to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and antitrust authorities.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear lives change" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come every day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The infutility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being "watery."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"" "Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" "" "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was pillaged with threats" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the citizen council for public security and the government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 murder. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings a day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Appointa Vivir Con El Narco" Animal Político created the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015 whose aim is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has emerged for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the place Sange in the east of DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to this.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball rolling up dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses sprayed and corpted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to oblivion.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That's Nigeria." by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the greyish scenes of that day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of lost bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left behind to count corpses," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been cut, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated visually.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from DR Congo again, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented orders on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example erroneously bring about the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report, published by the United Nations, those who fleeing could flee, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following arose which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi-Arab news site, falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar's Thein has said, monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to capture this information.</seg>

<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo puzzled with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was taken as evidence of the massacres of the Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages related thereto were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">This sentiment of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and does it taste the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which actually can also be used detached from the context or in a completely improper way.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. confusing) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudades) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu-clap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze and classify the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "invaluable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They are unleasing me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head towel in public buildings, and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body, both sides of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why am I telling this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars will be led and people by the creation of the "other" in the public mind, were self-employed at Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and unconsciously the "other" as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women's March because the employment that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he is already bombarded by broken countries and "to other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been organising events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often" "" "is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "can be heard" "" "listening to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers start their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story-teller, their devotion and their representation result in the audience reviewing.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotion, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the Dafing language. during this turn, storyteller Rassidatou Konata takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the rabbits and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamara is asked: "how is this to talk to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand it. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story telling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march launched at the Puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture aimed at Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Surinquiry).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements are built up for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in prison since March 2012 in Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police Bassel took on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and made note of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently outgoing director of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototyping was more foreward than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This journey into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel wasn't able to finish this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a profiled she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for one year together in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, until 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We reiterate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted director after release again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, along with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment on account of the misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800,000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not promise the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, abbreviated CIP), condemned the company's decision to address the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary action against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "contrary":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambriza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison term and half of which had settled.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It's a contradiction!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any morale:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral to return and to serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself by the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become weary of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel prison, not only for ever being the first independent president to be remembered, but also as sharp, cutting-edge and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he forcefully confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the Fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious person is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison; he sat down for 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, at which he defile funds, is under contract again. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яαλSoboul (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as adjectives "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "all-in-one" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt in order to express their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitters), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmesan - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be more analytic before all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next door.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "and" "" "Kalar pae" "" "(splitting bsen)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who disseminate hate speech will get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete, post and share content for 24 hours because the mail "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also fuel the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflict between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the balancing hate speeches on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, rather in context as initiatives focused on code and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technically experienced Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all of the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine host connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of the legal prohibition, but accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having listened to the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put all the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors, when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how he helped him achieve this first-class position in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida's Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already standing face to face with tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of the Buzzler appeared. he immediately goes, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women, with the greatest care, avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also do not name their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far less admittance to fear, if at all, they should not come back to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers as well as housewives, entered a unique club and became the main social theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the Video Volunteers community and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paese has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the disclosure of practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected people, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round dealt with women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands do not speak out loud, is a custom that they are all dubious and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name so far, wanted to try at home at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "practice, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "patriarchy" "" "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had just chuckled before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the full frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zincamber point on the forehead that marks the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped altogether, but they think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves, not to carry it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what they could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, such as our identities attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwas-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pant; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morals linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question as to whether in the five months since its first discussion club had already changed something, Rohini confirmed that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to tell the name of their husbands; only one or two women wear Zinnoberred at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, is disturbing the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a glorious man could bring gold or bring wealth, the policeman of Zambézia told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of killings for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police have already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of single-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a belief existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power, generating wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair fall problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1603">I am ashamed of a country where people would have been ashamed to demand sex against good marks, work and other accomplishments, a nation in which people would revert honest occupations and even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for superstitious purposes or "black magic."</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Foreign Ministry in China referred to Lius case as an" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a spokesman said he was" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him to treat abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about his release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the export of salmon to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she announced in a declaration on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Lius's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to Reuters news agency that China had great qualms if the fuss around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada, Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be surrounded by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum further tells:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to allow for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian grounds on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo obtains all treatments he needs, regardless of where he is needed. furthermore his wife and his family are supposed to have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information if France would eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu-Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with a declaration on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would lead to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This statement sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritary exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', considering that, it seemed inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam put answers to his American guests regarding our press, our dictatorial, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He could answer corresponding questions rationally with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out critics concerning the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was more a" "" "city" "" "than a country, he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore was" "" "no land" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemic statement as leader of an adolescent generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - either I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes he is right and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam put" "" "good faith" "" "a mistake or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, will we only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singaporeans make their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country" "", "etc., but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly rage if they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famed in Thailand has released a music video depicting the Junta who seized power in 2014 and, in spite of their promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what regulations he makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video indirectly refers to the ongoing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as regards the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which grants absolute decision-making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest campaigners and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and prosecuted persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand sets a strict" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(majority insult)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems which the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">It is rather quiet at the moment, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medications that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests send her often text messages when she went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul de sac leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to squeeze money out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travellers constantly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about her house full, but she's also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with lots of photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair lichens she has made a Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang from twitter users in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In announcing the police, the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "malicious information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend on-line and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, crowded, ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (full-screen) that published censored news in China showed photos of a checkpoint where police checked the occupants randomly if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can unlock the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office at the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of Urumqi, a regional capital of Urumqi, to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole range of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he shuffles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to flee their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned its tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, Racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria up to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he hates a special aversion against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "Hdaib emphasizes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a person," while he pours in water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal in the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the wares speak lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose, primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to avoid doing basic things - as in public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "was canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band's engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free speech in the Arab world is dangerous activism, questioning the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila prioritized the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to choose "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved traditional sex-storms to Leibe by indulging in his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently laid down unknown woman whose arms and legs extend to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of 'Honorary Primorants' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of murders or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a" "" "crime against crime" "" "Act of 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "" "be held in prison indefinitely" "", "and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from themes that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political but admits that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was informed of politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse repeats itself notably:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want "- whether it is faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to note later that his comments were torn from context, distorted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not contrary to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nua, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuova, who later should work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashtou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association with the reason that they have critically commented on the issues related to the corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan did not prevent Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream about bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially produced democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time comes, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies marched from the west of Japan to the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to its knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the meguro Gajoen for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breath-taking way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-meter-tall car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">It is rare that external appearances and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youths from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street and illegal drugs trade are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences growing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens are entering the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair styling tools and to obtain a training in the hairdresser's art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a career that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year that started in March and reported some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to meet people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation was no longer inspired by the Young Youth Foundation's campaign and inspired them to write letters to reconciliation, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the Peace Treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombians, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would close together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day: inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo by the Bogotway Foundation travelled to the camp to personally convey the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of protecting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," explained the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garret, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he said," "" "I'll answer a letter someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him fully, and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now that peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice done by the State to the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated, even people with beautiful feelings turned around with their living circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, raise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and make sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that address the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of Chechen authorities arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she sensed that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their land woman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear about her life, she eventually moved to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, you scandy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">At the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which guards were you laid - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya in order to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by running above without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has damaged not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without registering me, without proof, without proof of everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message: "you do not believe, you would be safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are hiding. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you, it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have remained dortted?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who took in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "so I mean, they probably charge the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to submit to Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were purposefully submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports until now. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation have already occurred in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to approach" "" "Civilization" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never weaned a hair on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said that children are funny about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but rather about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreps, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is true.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to show you foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays in them.</seg>

<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is most important to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 saw the desperate situation of the Arab ancestor community in Iran dominated by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi's human rights groups who would like to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - were hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who, due to the persecution of the Iranian government, were helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population has little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams to divert water from the Arab territories in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youth increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all Feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still perverted through the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and three.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on black women, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and sing" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "to achieve equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence in addition to sexualized violence, which we are exposed to black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of every skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join as a black woman in a movement, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take injustices in her mind, which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a menace and marginalised being in historical proportions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs to drive forward their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different income a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanismus, which was called for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than advocating for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming (example: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm, I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither skipped nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena showed due to maltreatment, Ada Báez's detailed ad also took advantage of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman left her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make an announcement at all, they generally do not receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>

<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General issued 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courses. 86% of women's advertisements were also shown here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's ministries Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "there are 9 women who do not do so in Paraguay because of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "there are two women who will not do this for physical abuse," "" "she said at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, every ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that she was supposed to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she wore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long from Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ill-treated.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original draft plan envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must wear at present, if they just want to submit an ad and obtain a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>

<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, among other things, a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi Health System.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be receiving receivers instead of being a filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines are making articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outrageous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents were not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants such as cereals or carrots. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding salad, but he now needs a longer time since his work is increasingly hampered by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like there's a boulder in a river that I have to dumpy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far for salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of sage, because all the features are already patented. "he continues to make as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and all over the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the Outrageous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free open source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds, cross it in order to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow them - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control on seeds and the ability to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which, for example, is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep others available to their seeds free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool, due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted, shrinks incessantly.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all carrots characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders either at all or only very difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specific desirable traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders goes through more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property can restrict other breeders because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote." "" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, it promotes it by providing the public with more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years wait for a patent to run, certainly not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "but the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant features: "we don't really create the traits themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation is needed masses of herbicides, is breeding into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) have patents, most of the smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they refuse the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent for 20 years, it is protected from competition, which makes it quite simple for my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explained that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it contradicts the current practice of the European patent law allowing patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>

<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open-source seed seed systems for which the official start-up should be planned for the next year.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship targets in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true despite this attack and the ridicule of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law to reveal the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website blockages fallen victim. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to the ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to bypass the Egyptian government's censorship, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking the blogs is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; a arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities locked websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, which was possible through the encroachment of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web sites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter contents on which Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army deployed in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the governmental crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day by day newspapers in whole Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second-largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy, and air sea to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 Violence of Violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the newspaper" Extra "published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper then explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. however, which deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't even know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are 843 areas according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "do more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against denouncing violence as a "war." in her opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold accountability to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown by an extra on the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to the statistics of 2015, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil," says Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most recent available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the morals per state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the biggest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit issued by Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police command and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decrease in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repressions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also causing serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this involves entering the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an uncharted point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly driven by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel areas have been besieged outside Damascus, which led to the need for residents of locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints of smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how to plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant it in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many areas in Portugal on 21 October and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the North of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died, and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a state shower last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in four districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal explained the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the authorities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when residents searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used fogos.pt's own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the João Pina developer in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers failed to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party, dominated by Hazara, was just murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara abandoned the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars, who were heavier than himself, in order to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been affected by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recalls Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf made his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed food to aid in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers, but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unimaginable personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum, which after the registration of the asylum application can still be applied for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who don't have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncompromising way of life helped Asharaf to soon release himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of construction work in the construction industry, Asharaf put all his savings in the creation of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans run business, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and aim to go back to the country he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearing of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months of successful legalization on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the ending of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the law applied by sixty parliamentary members is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be debated there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce more severe penalties for the insult of the President or a high ranking officer.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the Egyptian law, the insult of the president as well as state institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such action would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who were demonstrating against the military coup led to the inauguration of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false burden of inter alia arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza was acquitted of the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi session blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to hear all-leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of law, which would assure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption charges against officials amnesty if they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April at the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the attribution of his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to show their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached in conversations within social networks. until now, it is not clear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as" "" "organiser of information distribution" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that will organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">On these websites are currently websites like Vkontakte and OdnoTrans (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was closed because it became" "" "a source of information that collaborates with groups to make a political diffuse campaign against Turkey" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is with it, among other things China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop muffling</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time and install Backdoor programs encrypting data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
