that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him , because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times journalist .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he discovered spectacular that the N@@ SA heard illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed out blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified risks and called upon him to name its alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked on tears , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although for years they have indicated that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing and bringing tears to the testimony , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his phone records secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit information , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and the alleged source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result that a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist as ris@@ king had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to kill offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers ,
or the nearest environmental officer , who al@@ erts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der , who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has ha@@ v@@ ases in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next exposed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent American who came to this scandal in this scandal .
now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to form a company than to obtain a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ ders to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects everyone .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really shocked us that all of us made suggestions for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very sad , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that some things started to change .
over the last few years , we have seen violations of transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned .
the subject took political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind it .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both Par@@ liam@@ entary Cham@@ bers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ light companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally finish the transparency which is now allowing this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my clothes .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me excit@@ edly how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t w@@ anna land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get up there ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sliding down to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something for it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for $ 20 on the air mattress on the wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door was falling into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business plan .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
keep your thumb up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ hand sitting @-@ neighbour .
this silent approach of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests also feel like they stay overnight somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores cell phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he can@@ died for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 testim@@ oni@@ als that all say : &quot; he can really keep very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you &apos;d have to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust depends on how much you cost .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I am making holidays with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a demand that had not been met before .
for us , business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have rav@@ aged dwell@@ ings .
hosts have left guests standing in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think only of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem .
for people trust one another rightly .
if trust works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to have a heart attack due to se@@ dent@@ ary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one .
you go to hospital in your own car when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay runs off .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is about economic commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group of residents would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show you at a pub drive quarter of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing the common part ?
I imagine cities enabling us to make society and relationships instead of soli@@ tude and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a ble@@ b ,
were given to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ bat@@ ors were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality had existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we could use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study showed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that most Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homos@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence , which I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should we do something like that ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and start building up .
I remember how I dig@@ ged -- when we ro@@ de -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was dre@@ aded for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be vel@@ v@@ ety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed within the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , broke free and sm@@ ote them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain oneself continually .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we release it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stopping the terror .
regular attendance of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their families so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make bra@@ in@@ washing that leads the extre@@ mi@@ sts to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from the faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as Muslims , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at them , it doesn &apos;t drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , saying that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of governance , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people submit messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they prefer military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
when you see when the mood sw@@ ings up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not only about self @-@ explaining .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was at the dental clinic , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man become a young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited him in the afternoon .
he shot dead eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed himself and welcomed our guests , as half of the assembled groups were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be on number safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , work in a clas@@ sy thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you so much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before air pack@@ et delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower made of 1 500 bricks in front of the public . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
connecting terminals achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ yourself load@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the highest level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star @-@ wing@@ ed gl@@ ers , it can ho@@ ver , and thus has major advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying machine no matter which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay .
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which only had two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ iner , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross rods , no further actu@@ ators or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly .
the likel@@ ihood of throwing it right when all is watching me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ iner is an exercise in in@@ suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability to do so ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some models are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
when flying machines are part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this revol@@ ves clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by being half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines the synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a pal@@ let of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press is to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit each other more and more quickly in a very far distant gal@@ axy . they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise around by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance enormously .
so now you call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes ro@@ amed through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my to@@ dd@@ ly father .
that was basically the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the fabric of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other .
in order to illustrate the theory of rel@@ ativity , lec@@ turers often lead a really al@@ ber@@ n@@ ating dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ pped by us during the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Therefore , the Lig@@ o employees declared ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and certainly all obstacles will be overcome with the support of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
it is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that particularly mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them we cannot make simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speaking .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already occupied for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; someone who knows what he must hear , sees this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass that revol@@ ves around as quickly as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s talk about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ tive stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the aid of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that all things exist that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to take a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of removing my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ explained reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess I need milk for my na@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I was afraid to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , stir you up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I &apos;m making TV , in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program to the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes that simultaneously are in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes simultaneously : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 H@@ ours of Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are consi@@ gn@@ ments I created myself , and not just produced , so still on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or household , take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I &apos;m not just lying around the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream about dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as if you &apos;re wearing a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , ar@@ du@@ ous and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the tot@@ als .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it .
many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , you do it .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began working and working and working and doing , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the tot@@ als is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive other than by size .
the feeling of not being able to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not a failure , and I just know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more boundaries , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I just this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was off .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you work , you work , you love what you do , to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and this gives you the hum@@ ming when you already know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are being made aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it does not call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I am a titanium and my hum@@ ming drunk , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of breath , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ ps and the song in which it goes to letting go , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door comes up and an energy boost comes in .
and this is not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums , the working environment , the titanium um@@ ming , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the tot@@ als is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on the love .
the tot@@ als are the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because what God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t care how to play .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at home than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of man works better than being at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think of nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me after 15 minutes .
and I am talking to my teen@@ age daughter all 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , but it doesn &apos;t need more .
everyone can get 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m victorious . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track , why not allow full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s a pity that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sum : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me spreads . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll raise you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
certainly , they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in this process , one electro@@ de deeply im@@ planted in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mata .
in order to save life , the cran@@ ial pressure must be reduced .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you need to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François worked .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non @-@ linguistic areas and then cultivate the cells exactly how it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ pil@@ ed them at the reception point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ pil@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they van@@ ish .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small d@@ ots . these are the cells we in vitro dy@@ e in culture .
of course , we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously rec@@ uper@@ ated up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey who spontaneously caught up .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that was very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it takes to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as inv@@ ari@@ able entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing in Europe , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are mil@@ ked , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt hill and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the last 3 months , 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the USA , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until it compar@@ es it to the US $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion , who at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and drive up real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that , as in an endless loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , out of fear , the prophecy of the O@@ rak@@ h could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing ede@@ ma to kill him .
this is my rowing with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to saving the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was , and is , that she involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive which she gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same coher@@ ence in questions of the state bel@@ ong@@ ings .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was narrow@@ ed to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two by gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ solving them .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my con@@ tention with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has decim@@ ated the animals that feed them so sustain@@ ably that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has hurri@@ can@@ ised politics so widely that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; hold control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has brought forth .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or through something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used and people are in the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ good Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who owned the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not owned by the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : just imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interests of the whole of humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , particularly against the backdrop of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world that I describe to you is at the same time the liber@@ als in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash@@ ore of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we are better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Charles Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do that , technological development will create such a massive drop in macro@@ economic demand , called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not angry , you don &apos;t think it is enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the or@@ ators , you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ elling huge according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and continuing denial that a massive d@@ umping line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have still chosen the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be possible for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you expect ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he asser@@ ts that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they have been conducting a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika len@@ ders who imposed this policy on us stood up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the discussions , you seem to be more pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be as detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is Manager at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ eats and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating .
if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after having looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price is not concerned about the left side of the curve , because I think one already needs special intelligence to sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium output , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use them .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can look at everyone for free .
and if Amazon puts out things for nothing , one gets to grasp , right ?
millions of spectators look at these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or watch again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the reviews they give the shows their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , which actors ?
when they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic in some way states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you optimize it by using very powerful computers .
the minimum thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is fired or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that , through data analysis , it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data increasingly flows into decisions of life -- at work , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there were data , this was the device for decision @-@ making .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will show it later on with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know naturally , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions , being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
