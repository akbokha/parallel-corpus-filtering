<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times journalist.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he discovered spectacular that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed out blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified risks and called upon him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on tears, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although for years they have indicated that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and bringing tears to the testimony, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his phone records secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit information, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and the alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result that a whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist as risking had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to kill offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the nearest environmental officer, who alerts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leck in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has havases in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next exposed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their wealth in tax havens and not paying all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent American who came to this scandal in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information to form a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudders to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects everyone.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US in order to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of us made suggestions for our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very sad, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that some things started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the last few years, we have seen violations of transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been collecting in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both Parliamentary Chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlight companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally finish the transparency which is now allowing this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my clothes.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me excitedly how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while paying the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't wanna land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself say:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, as please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get up there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sliding down to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something for it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for $20 on the air mattress on the wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door was falling into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former mate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business plan.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people publish images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on things that you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Keep your thumb up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left-hand sitting-neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests also feel like they stay overnight somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he candied for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 testimonials that all say: "he can really keep very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the people most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust depends on how much you cost.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you will not get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "great works of art in your apartment! I am making holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have ravaged dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests standing in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"" "" "" "I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken." ""</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I think only of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust one another rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to have a heart attack due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to hospital in your own car when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay runs off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply called" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group of residents would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show you at a pub drive quarter of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities enabling us to make society and relationships instead of solitude and isolationism.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents. students who were looking for a bleb,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubators were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality had existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we could use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that most Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">"" "" "" "I decided to do this." ""</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, which I felt as a 17 year old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..." "..."... "..." Jihad... ""... bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and start building up.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I digged -- when we rode -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was dreaded for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said:" "" "be watchful," "" "" "" "Be careful," "" "" "" "Abide in well lit areas," "" "" "" "Do not be velvety." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed within the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings came:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims, broke free and smote them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I've got the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain oneself continually.</seg>

<seg id="319">"" "" "" "it is the accusations that are hard." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic champions.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular attendance of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their families so that the extremists may make brainwashing that leads the extremists to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from the faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "holy book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throw a look at them, it doesn't drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, saying that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people submit messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they prefer military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you see when the mood swings up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective debt, it is not only about self-explaining.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental clinic, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has such a young man become a young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited him in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot dead eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled my shoes off, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked himself and welcomed our guests, as half of the assembled groups were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, work in a classy thought factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower made of 1 500 bricks in front of the public. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting terminals achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-yourself loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turmoil and generally respond to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be" "" "started" "" "and" "" "landing" "" "at the highest level." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most star-winged glers, it can hover, and thus has major advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying machine no matter which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which only had two moving parts: one propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospiner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross rods, no further actuators or controller surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when all is watching me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospiner is an exercise in insufficiency, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability to do so,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some models are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by being half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines the synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe press is to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes orbit each other more and more quickly in a very far distant galaxy. they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise around by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">So now you call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes roamed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my toddly father.</seg>
<seg id="491">That was basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stout into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In order to illustrate the theory of relativity, lecturers often lead a really albernating dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stripped by us during the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros according to the comma, followed by a 1. Therefore, the Ligo employees declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows: "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and certainly all obstacles will be overcome with the support of the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that particularly mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just speaks Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speaking.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has already occupied for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] someone who knows what he must hear, sees this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass that revolves around as quickly as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massertive stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the aid of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that all things exist that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak, the dinosaurs for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to take a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year, I would say," "" "Yes!" "" "that I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of removing my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "my life changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "estimating" "" "for unexplained reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "I guess I need milk for my navel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on I was afraid to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "Yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things out, stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making TV, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes that simultaneously are in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes simultaneously: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 Hours of Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are consignments I created myself, and not just produced, so still on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around camp fires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or household, take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I'm not just lying around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it doesn't dream about dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you're wearing a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, arduous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the totals.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, you do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working and working and working and doing, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The totals is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive other than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to aspire to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not a failure, and I just know that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more boundaries, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the humming.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you work, you work, you love what you do, to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and this gives you the humming when you already know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are being made aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "guess" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it does not call anyone" "" "estimating" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am a titanium and my humming drunk, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of breath, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax craps and the song in which it goes to letting go, or whatever the girl leaves in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door comes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this is not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium umming, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and TV-hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totals is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals are the current that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because what God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't care how to play.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of man works better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think of naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">A Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me after 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I am talking to my teenage daughter all 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, but it doesn't need more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it is not necessary to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's a pity that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the most famous, the "deep brain stimulation." in this process, one electrode deeply implanted in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure increases with skull-brain traumata.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, the cranial pressure must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François worked.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non-linguistic areas and then cultivate the cells exactly how it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-piled them at the reception point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-piled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they vanish.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small dots. these are the cells we in vitro dye in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course, we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recuperated up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously caught up.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it takes to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as invariable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is waning in Europe, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are milked, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt hill and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the last 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars have been invested in the USA, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until it compares it to the US $5.1 trillion, who at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and drive up real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that, as in an endless loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, who, out of fear, the prophecy of the Orakh could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing edema to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my rowing with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in Athenic democracy was, and is, that she involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive which she gave them the right to political co-determination with the same coherence in questions of the state belongings.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was narrowed to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two by gradually undermining politics and dissolving them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because the power of politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my contention with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, which has decimated the animals that feed them so sustainably that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has hurricanised politics so widely that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" hold control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it -- very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must redesign the economy and reunite the spheres of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," or through something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used and people are in the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" -good Utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is working from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who owned the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not owned by the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: just imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging economies], in the interests of the whole of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, particularly against the backdrop of a reunited policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe to you is at the same time the liberals in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the trashore of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we are better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Charles Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do that, technological development will create such a massive drop in macroeconomic demand, called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not angry, you don't think it is enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the orators, you said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say this provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smelling huge according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to complacency, and continuing denial that a massive dumping line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have still chosen the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be possible for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you expect?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he asserts that he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been conducting a disastrous programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika lenders who imposed this policy on us stood up:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the discussions, you seem to be more pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released centrifuges will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is Manager at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igeleats and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after having looked at a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price is not concerned about the left side of the curve, because I think one already needs special intelligence to sign" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium output, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can look at everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon puts out things for nothing, one gets to grasp, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over or watch again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom via four republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team looked at the data on the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, which actors?</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic in some way states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by using very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a dismissal is fired or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that, through data analysis, it could predict outbreaks of flu, the bad type, by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data increasingly flows into decisions of life -- at work, in the case of law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious choices, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disassemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something in which the brain is good, it is to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards" did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision, because they could always say:" "" "this is what we say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the device for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will show it later on with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know naturally, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions, being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
