Munich , 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not current .
everyone knows everyone who has had to get upset because the car @-@ na@@ i instead of a stra@@ pping road showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but especially very enligh@@ tening .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ ination sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
these were made according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying business .
the manuscript for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was registered 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered hall@@ ways from the so @-@ called &quot; Big recording , &quot; derived from the basic tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots are no more farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October test , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based circular mad@@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden initiated the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and for example ended the Ank@@ le of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also forbi@@ ds the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ al in Haar in 1905 .
Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West lies the football field of TS@@ V München East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children &apos;s house was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel dating back to the Middle Ages , once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days take place and on April 5 , 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the Adv@@ ancement of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur in the whole country and be noted here , &quot; it says in the Group &apos;s opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted Law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination law@@ suits , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state which dispro@@ portion@@ ately targets minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of citizens &apos; rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are served 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring some chew@@ ing money or letting the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report program , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of injuries on the country &apos;s 16th .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws forcing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in view of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ watering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a successful project and will continue next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
at the square yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U town association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals looked after and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t profit@@ ably manage on such steep faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area ensures a lot of work , a lot must be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not conduct organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to bring their business further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the electric fence .
the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of wheat sp@@ ells .
&quot; the great advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and land@@ wives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state funding of wheat f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
furthermore , the area to be f@@ enced cannot be tractor @-@ controlled ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the fishing industry in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence for almost 16 kilometres , is currently underway .
the open space equ@@ als 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues .
the Americans like this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ eers would have liked him if he had done so .
but he attacked its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter here a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , the miserable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States .
this conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s importance .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus had changed the significance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the na@@ zzy world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch will not light the way , but light the hatred , which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship title will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland has developed something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and has to learn something from the athle@@ tics of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think there is something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain from the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her captains &quot; speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ range driver Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year he set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that you should watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics about Facebook : do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he le@@ aped in criticism , confident .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have vo@@ iced their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
this is why the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Spe@@ aker A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news show &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence protest@@ ors .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this issue was Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers making Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since they were taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish presence since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
this is the result of a study conducted by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher , Head of the Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer cases due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are more or less in time , &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze &apos;s director .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of mountains underground , which is not visible in the plans .
the traffic that hin@@ ders construction works is a big problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction team .
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite ti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and Death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , it does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai community in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ amy floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare glimpse of the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch government , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated iron roofs , which were converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ea .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua wood resources are valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollar .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s have been genocide , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ ome All Com@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week passes by incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim business migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
jav@@ an@@ ese waiting can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables to the traditional market more che@@ ap@@ ly than the local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native of Papua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - her market . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ the@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers fell on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le flas@@ ks , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young young men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and led the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started hur@@ ling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; is said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ak still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he has an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus re@@ affir@@ med that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday , Indones@@ ian police fired the villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to hold accoun@@ tability to the participating officers and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a reputation for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development rein@@ forces the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free State Army ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the State by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ira airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete in their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign , the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ a : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokesman of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to know this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ o again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants that Jok@@ the@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fault &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sho@@ oting caused a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second firing , which in only two years swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch Building following its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from facing , out@@ fits for decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) , with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly , failed .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single for this Sport was only supported by two @-@ thirds of the two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ sentence classics are retained the traditional value .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership has not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote , after many claims , the proposal has already come to place the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training stations etc. will be facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they were late discovered that they were mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also found that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
those sur@@ vey@@ ed admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the X generation .
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods had been brought about by airport security and how many had done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while people thought that the T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased to announce the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far avoided that a portion of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zzling figure : the canc@@ ell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ positions for the new car , whose extra@@ dition was just beginning .
Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 were already withdrawn from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ positions .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are charged , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe that the cancellation of up to now twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be put together - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are greater delays , then the binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running off in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state @-@ owned environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous position in a federal court .
it is about a deadline that expi@@ red on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for o@@ zone near to earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was a prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly referred to blocking or dela@@ ying regulation that re@@ fut@@ ed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority than he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday night , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then been waiting to set up the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ version of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York State Prosecutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and thousands of premature deaths each year .
public health officials and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to engage in environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and sponsors tum@@ bled to their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martin@@ i emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer deed book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen along with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wor@@ ding of the document , besides the former parish church , was also a wonderful courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ess belonged to it and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement core of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age right originated from the early medieval owner &apos;s law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
in doing so , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two is Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary Church was canc@@ eled .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm out@@ dated the steep@@ le and half of them collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the remaining Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Vor@@ steh@@ er Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers set out fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the promot@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for tur@@ ne@@ es and horns .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bow feel particularly committed to their home care , as confirmed by Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Martin@@ i .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee any legal requirements for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines is possible at the same time , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .
such zones are meant to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted allowance is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again decre@@ ed the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been dealt with since last week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen participated in the middle of the year , closed the lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of some 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , the City Council gave its green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in case of a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal accident .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the road remained closed for hours .
a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother , drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel in the context of the accompanying journey with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city holds away from the usual supermarket merchandise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the closer region .
in preparation there are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
these include new offerings , such as the first &quot; Active Day , &quot; for the well @-@ known Sunday , and talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to make them active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping from the view .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had partly wi@@ dened , had told King in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thurin@@ gian cities take part in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
beside Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his direct environment with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
construction work resulted in a gas explosion in the school building .
new people have been injured .
during a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire department , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later recovered .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a cause of un@@ happiness , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy at the holiday time .
Tr@@ ump put pressure on telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump demanded in a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to the report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists conduct rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury launched a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with rif@@ les emerged to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside , the in@@ mates were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cries burst into silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged down from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene played on July 22 is just one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience came out with very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were re @-@ syn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see it in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organization of creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court doctor lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FBI documents received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding neighbor@@ hoods were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the election campaign in the summer .
at about the same time , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com , according to the FBI , stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they came from prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , cleared the evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ isely .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and founded in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that it does not exist in America any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I &apos;ve made through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be simpler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ ya Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cries out H@@ ester and push@@ es him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies with the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of comra@@ des@@ hip replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends with violent and fast repetition .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman suffering from mour@@ ning stands above the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays to the sad speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they all experienced Georgi@@ as for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial grounds of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ p@@ ses .
children ho@@ ck in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ ropes and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience meets with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white couple from Atlanta tells about the post @-@ creation with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski is struggling to find words in which the performance has left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I really do with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s court holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ delivery is in some way inspir@@ ational because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner @-@ ians in Bay@@ reuth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf follows a colorful and fri@@ vol@@ ous setting in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sk@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo of GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ gro@@ wers pose as rock @-@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .

there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his director .
in 2013 he had to let go of a continuation of the pipe concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school already in the open whole day .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken my Abit@@ ur .
and then a civil engineering course , let &apos;s say , successfully stopped .
I know for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I am going to study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from a degree in civil engineering ?
quantity : well aware , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people in front of each other , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - must always be individually prepared for it .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure on which the company is confronted .
the job cuts announced by the Director General John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 are in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 positions have already been lost .
in May , in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , divided a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the attack in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the US military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a princip@@ ally Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , after which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 States su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is supposed to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature reserves that concern the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants to have a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ za resol@@ ves to establish a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence .
there is an important information before the discussion : the purchase contract for the still missing plot of land is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time for the area to be owned by the church community until now , there is no more planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ vering , such a common space not only to be seen as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget will be sweet@@ ened by funding opportunities already last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the resolution proposed to signal the investor that in this respect it does not want to t@@ oss sticks between legs , stating that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which are le@@ aning against the surrounding area - as well as a desk roof - which reduce the pitch and make the construction more economical - are possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says this addition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of our own buildings with which you don &apos;t go so well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus , but I get a real counter @-@ value that is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ man &apos;s motion to split the proposal , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we touch the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
during the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was seriously injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by bike on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer road towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted preced@@ ence over him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the winner .
the personnel of the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ ausen Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical shape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
wandering in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ ss und Si@@ eber .
the information on the tables is to be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ ting Path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewer experiences a lot of knowledge , for example the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it lies far farther away .
I will also teach in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ tchen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , the University of Göttingen has been running something similar to the planned star@@ ting@@ g - the planet path since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium .
beginning at Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Gemeinde Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to dem@@ oted to the d@@ warf @-@ planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 @-@ meter distance measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s win by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko went to vote .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound dé@@ but this year to arrange a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title battle in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he was fond of Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he could possibly participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held up with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show punch strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after the tire rup@@ ture
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was probably losing control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 in front of the connection point .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he beat himself and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ cycle works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 start of the season op@@ ener of Braunschweig for the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , because the two opponents were not at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defence player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ cycle should also be further optimized .
and one goal after a free kick won &apos;t let the Fort@@ une catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just worked in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we can &apos;t afford so much playing mistakes in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing of this .
&quot; I only judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage to Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a Ascension favorite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inner defender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to attend the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away only because we have the right to get among the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the beginning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s boss @-@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ body doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seekers review published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Ministry of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum process , you should take a closer look at the evaluation of age after the Swedish Migration Administration ( Migration Sales ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , 6,@@ 8@@ 80 trials have been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; potentially 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied over his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people in order to see if they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is close to 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a concrete part of the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a rain@@ bow bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy bridge cap on the northern side .
this is a peripheral for@@ tification , which is also used as an operating path .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
on top of that the pedestrian path is going to take place .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special touch of finger has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective pastures in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is controlled by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridge lines amounts to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites Ron@@ dell in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle too loud .
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D voters , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town pick@@ nick was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain site , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the forum A world and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel , he tried to do such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirchen there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing is that it stays peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian Tr@@ ump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or also &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo tenor of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire to not only cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix together to form a fascinating overall artwork .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher clo@@ ister church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything out , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart was quite open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship with Hollywood stars was that of their &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve been posting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them , they suffered according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but during school time , when they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain to her love life : &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would hin@@ der us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only fifteen provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin , said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he decided to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been gra@@ bbed away from competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships held on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he told re@@ porters in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral p@@ act for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the North Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers have thought about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ explained crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old headquarters of Nord@@ h@@ essen lived in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the branches of the mour@@ ning lay down li@@ lies , and the car@@ ers stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and smu@@ g@@ gled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ tmann has built the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn the crash , no one would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali was not shown by the Minister of the Le@@ yen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use was dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always f@@ lown up , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk costumes instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from a possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , however , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
s &amp; D Group president , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to encourage his Group to include it .
that would have CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the country &apos;s day as soon as possible resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag takes the trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;

she described herself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens urged the de@@ pu@@ dent legis@@ lators to return their country parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that they have received their land tag , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the local chairman Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot track this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of El@@ ke T@@ wins from Lower Saxony to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not just betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians in their past vanity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony carries this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest power , SPD and Green party in front of the SPD , but in the country day a very thin majority came from one voice .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect against gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the scandal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial office of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states introduce the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has ceased immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same effect as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are transport and are safe to health .
if the residual water content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg has been exceeded , these are not transport @-@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production companies do not have an immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control over the incident .
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out .
it is precisely for this reason that consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly offen@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the pan@@ de@@ mic funds , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and seamlessly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered editions of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come from the UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can easily make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the funding of the team by the wealthy family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success , che@@ ated effectively and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
despite the fact that Plat@@ ini is dis@@ gra@@ ced by the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the FF@@ P for the UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenue for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros can be recorded in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players , instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments made by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar W@@ WM will become an ambassador and simply be able to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because there are different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ colate for Swiss Life .
now the sweet co @-@ operation takes place in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order anew .
Swiss @-@ speaking speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
about 17 million small red and white packed chocolate bars to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but important is always the advertising effect : for a shock producer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss will not be able to reveal how many applicants do it in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
the Swiss company has been distributing chocolate bars on board of its flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss two and a half years ago , Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also part of the short circuit , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael show alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a promising jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by stiff@@ ening on the core of the ga@@ g - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - they still manage to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering can principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sw@@ ings the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ Designer ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another mad @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ Designer ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ earned impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; mu@@ sta@@ che , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old st@@ acker .
these are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I perceive as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band , how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East versus West Ring@@ tone icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic is@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his agit@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office told Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
during the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 police officers were employed .
members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised crime crimin@@ ality , serious violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating Con@@ stance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
thus , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bonds of the gang .
Weise bek@@ la@@ ges large gaps in the foreign registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the ali@@ ens central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the information , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 local authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately cared for , data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the Register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can significantly slow back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics about sufficient people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to travel out at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such false statements , however , &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient funds , &quot; is therefore stated in the analysis .
meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this proceeds from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the lef@@ tist faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening decent recording conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is created for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors that make their blood available to strangers , not sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change in the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for each donation of 50 donated blood donations .
half as many booked Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month reluct@@ ant to increase as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary revenues would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that interest increases would be needed in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the cost of lending would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecast for this and next year downward corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast projected in May .
it has retained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest increase and GDP grew from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , as the tigh@@ tening gets worse first before it will improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income from the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is offset by a portion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pound .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation declined from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said it was expected to attract them back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exceeding in relation to its target of 2 % would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the swap rate mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals will exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ surgery pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which could reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered to healthcare via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known through anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p using clinical evidence collected and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Management Board of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now is to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Ministry of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , declined in 2014 from a large building in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot size apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage eye Mou@@ ll lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses by Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of art of engineering went into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important , so when you push the door up , it &apos;s very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that can help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard into something completely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate @-@ imperialist Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - written by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - owns about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of concern for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled him out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Ms. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ Shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna de LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to submit their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , where Col@@ in claims that mark has been paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept himself back , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ ump plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House that he wanted to fix : poor information that gets into the president &apos;s hands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep track of t@@ witter accounts under control , according to six former election campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter habit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has ever been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officers know what others do not know - that Tr@@ ump@@ ets d@@ umps without their interventions have yet to contain even more combus@@ ti@@ bles .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump Kontro@@ ver@@ sen .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has critic@@ ised false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos; mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get Post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped for .
the police all over Europe send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the campaign that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ eting thri@@ ll@@ ers hide from Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been a website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times this website has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least 11 of them based on evidence after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with a number of determined travellers on the base of the war , tra@@ ded by a tren@@ ch pulled by the community to demand a field in front of their man@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they had only been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local charge if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ controversial at the time of the council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof we have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for some time , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already at an elevated centre @-@ level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broad@@ ly positioned , explains Sch@@ erer .
both vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople should feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Director of Tourism Michael Kr@@ ause have already led him to Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are similar to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reck@@ ons just under one million euros .
the external installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee accepted the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
CN@@ N reported that there were already the first sum@@ mons of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between the Com@@ election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation should focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also magni@@ fied more and more tr@@ umps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally moved to the centre and accused the accus@@ ation of whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in potential crimes and to decide whether to impose charges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Grand Jury is also called the Prosec@@ ution .
usually they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to pre @-@ charge persons for the interro@@ gation under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were already issued , which revol@@ ved around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement , called it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the sub@@ stitution will show that Mu@@ eller does not allow himself to be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the suspension of the parliament was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this work usually works in secret , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that expe@@ dite the work of the investig@@ ator in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief , James Com@@ ey , said three times that not against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this way , it was said in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ej@@ ection , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become noisy , he has hin@@ dered justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey spoke before a Senate committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after portra@@ ying US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bills of law on Thursday , after which the investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the Western Antar@@ cti@@ ca a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin detached from the ice shelf .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing more than one tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now drive north and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest iron gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
it is not a danger for people .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the erup@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s until now .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and canc@@ ell@@ ations was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete cow@@ ard there .
it &apos;s a good idea that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sho@@ e file is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as at the moment .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks off at a key location .
the melting of ice @-@ ice and ice @-@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaci@@ ers can lead straight into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only very little , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ei is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists we argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s would now grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these scientists do not trace the departure of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , however , in recent decades many ice @-@ yards of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus t@@ ame to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants house @-@ tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle day marked 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the courses at the circle are obviously highly cov@@ eted .
there were about 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be published this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions at the M@@ ett@@ mann circuit .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recruitment and human resources development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the candidate shortage in the future .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show specific measures for cross entran@@ ts and include an educational initiative , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees who leave out of the service due to illness or age .
high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he caused a big surprise in the circle day for a big surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and struck the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want all the possibilities to be checked which permit a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come short @-@ term to a satisfactory solution , the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ of @-@ tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money is only when you change to a higher level , which is geared towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean to prevent them from continuing to adopt new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes on board the crew of rubber ding@@ h@@ y , which are delivered directly to traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting re@@ port@@ edly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ exposed by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must primarily have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner outdoor post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the look@@ out point reached the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga att@@ ests to e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , rather than compete in wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high staff@@ s included .
this has also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine which is increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some clubs will rise up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German embassy to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just the FIFA soccer simulation games are being challenged at the level of competition .
as in normal sports , Li@@ sts have long established themselves in which the pros compete against each other .
and in Asia &apos;s 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is this a real sport at all ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been confronted with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classic sports - for example elevated heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
I also need cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are travelling internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million .
that is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries have already passed on to the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class of instruction , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football first @-@ league clubs are obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department according to D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything remains as it always was during football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced Con@@ rad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy have suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day in which I am not gri@@ eving the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legitimate preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to request another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get up , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern tru@@ sts a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the Bin@@ de stop to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen in the C @-@ El@@ f for youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday , but he .
sugar l is best distributed to those with lots of ingredients that you want to keep in a whi@@ m .
those who have been chosen to enter Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flew over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
right behind , that &apos;s his position now , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked like the one who can best take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed trou@@ pe .
he had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal makes his missing fitness to over@@ play ( collap@@ sed hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on devil come out to the performance of the Asia trip ( collap@@ sed also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t not to drop neg@@ atively .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we have hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
player relo@@ cation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also picked up . &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye to some cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ ver an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believed in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known football player has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary is practically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captains Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and is be@@ fie@@ dert with our ladies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football tournament of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation sy@@ ringe .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
still this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 will be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ Spe@@ aker Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , in wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports being sack@@ ed for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Industry .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , but at the same time lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who want to employ wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied until now .
the Chamber of Commerce demands more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , Christian Bal@@ d@@ on , refers to calculations on the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sober@@ ing is further the broad@@ band expansion in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the Wind Turbin@@ es Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreement .
Audi shall change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW leader said the company said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles , also increase , which makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called write @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but to drive back under normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States ; others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to Volkswagen &apos;s profit dispro@@ portion@@ ately .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
wh@@ om@@ ever it attracts the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a real raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bau@@ haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to clear up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective wilderness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft was flying over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
mur@@ der@@ ous n@@ oses and laughter against suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested , among other things , as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after several stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble into drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to him , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working daily almost ten hours .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches his dro@@ ll characters continue to spread widely worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s odd for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he focuses more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions remin@@ ding of d@@ rought and disease @-@ transferring insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , the expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has implications for the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bial bacter@@ ium that tran@@ sm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are a lot of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts tourists not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are sufficient .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or car@@ tels , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear T @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated by the Committee to protect journalists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is still more tra@@ itor .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the road every day or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tels in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have upset the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ation problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ sounding investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she went .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love to the routine of his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before became known that sp@@ y@@ ware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen that the Gover@@ nor referred to as being un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are actually under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has made three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ poses on government spending , focusing on the governor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about preceding events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few characters and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is thei@@ rs .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez runs away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since then asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ appropriate society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kar@@ tell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day at which Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade enemies
at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the be@@ wil@@ dered ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered kind of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has ast@@ o@@ unded researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ pump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ cla@@ vation , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better mix himself into his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with care .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were driven by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ stal@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on critics concerning his life , including his preserved dar@@ min@@ ce to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ an era . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six @-@ ton@@ ne heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned in the sea after death and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ikes , which prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cas@@ u@@ alty still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a win in the lot@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
stored remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top .
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mil@@ lim@@ eter stems - and g@@ aff .
about 20 people were injured on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police reports , around 5 pm between the inter@@ connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm were almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks .
at first , there is no information about the exact number of the injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a mild to moderate injury , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a great supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich approximately ten kilometres long back@@ stage formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it was also on the back road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the features of the vehicle designers , who now have to face sensitive fin@@ es .
shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : company testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : one sits on the train and sleeps .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhau@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ur@@ passed or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspec@@ tor .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and de@@ compos@@ es the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the ticket inspec@@ tor without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to use the app of the train that DB navig@@ ator purchased , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; functions as follows : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button on the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant is at number Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already charged online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without a ticket control by our train crew member simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the greatest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on August 9 , 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... all the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we are used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she took her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ uson in the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary film called &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who was wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two spoke a conversation that they had &quot; about the black experience and the black state many times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience that she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women @-@ child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , who became a camping area when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism has been nur@@ tured by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson do not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns Er@@ shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me how these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ é &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; Fer@@ rell stated , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s news cameras have long disappeared , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been split@@ ting the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while one can say a bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the other shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is located , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
it will stop at the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been buying in the market hall for almost a week .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land ladies are always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall res@@ ett@@ les in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why grocery stores in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
because after all the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , as the rent there are often not tra@@ dable for a retail@@ er .
it &apos;s a pity , there &apos;s almost no special business , and what is left of it will disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually actually comes .
or does the gh@@ ost@@ ly bit gallery even manage to sell all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty also needs nobody .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg won &apos;t be a place anymore .
when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after having publicly classified diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2nd August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a fitting resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline unified her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form of DNA @-@ data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six off@@ ences against the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette stu@@ ff@@ ing and chew@@ ing gum to extract the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained mice became un@@ equal pounds , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a cartoon illustr@@ ating &quot; Supp@@ ressed images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president of Chelsea would translate judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also a little deeper and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump uses a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ ame the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how astonishing similar , at least in biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States &quot; disciplinary forces , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so keep your mouth shut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford @-@ University employee who was sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the County Court of Cook County .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and Det@@ ective investig@@ ates the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them is Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bin , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been vac@@ ated and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair which is being investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the investig@@ ative authorities in every way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand .
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he insisted on susp@@ ecting the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to respect the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia as part of the D@@ oping scandal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next user
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to be lucky with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people out of the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have most of the ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the top of workplace culture , so that you will not become the next person involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the fin@@ anz@@ tech website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables you to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ic , values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
scent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
with $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , g@@ lit@@ ters secured his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising in view of the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only possible .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools promise to increase third party commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy cler@@ ks .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , staff ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem relates to G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will always have new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to better binding of employees in a branch known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas .
some have moved out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ligh@@ ten the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three practice sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ id themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear line of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been ki@@ cked with foot@@ balls , which is located a protective grid behind a door@@ post , will not be a light task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust themselves there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fact @-@ checking in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit detection by third parties and then display their results under the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ishable by social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check was launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fact reviews are being challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shire man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says mel@@ anch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ dges May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so angry with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my Welcome greetings &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Pri@@ est , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it priest that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell designed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite ga@@ un@@ er , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to promote revenue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his mission in the castle .
he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle hidden in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secretly .
at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the plac@@ ards at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website un@@ folded yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that as bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens we know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the five vice @-@ ministers , as well as the Minister of Defence , Internal Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the consultations .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the navy were dismissed .
since the coup attempt , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ liner ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the major rein@@ car@@ nation of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan fired another 73@@ 95 government ser@@ vic@@ ers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly considered the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as the gu@@ ardian of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan once again pushed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , seeking asylum from persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not let Nato go cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ gations of the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump quoted from the media .
it fores@@ ees to lower the legal migrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US is spending the way citizens from other countries are spending Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate track for race track
over the past few months over the past few months the road toll road has been fought over and over again - now it is about to go very fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the end of the year , on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ailing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; route , on which the tourist train is going to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the road ticket office in the long term , construction work is scheduled to begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he paid the costs for the repair of the route to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gian railway have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this means that the race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the range of sufficient numbers of people will be used to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also partly strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are a great thing right now .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the release of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adjusted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one the most .
on his website true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toys .
its origins and increasing sophisti@@ cation point towards something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition .
most men will naturally not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the edge @-@ zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots show up at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the curved body and the stoch@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point when it comes to their personalities , the robots are not real women .
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are false slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid Service
pumps deliver great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of their relatives .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly har@@ assing all of us to burst our filter bags .
less noticeable is the power of Tr@@ ump to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it coinci@@ des with another connection that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs of one day will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump republi@@ cs of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year old and two women can go on it in the 40 @-@ s and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gri@@ pping , while I was tired of the experience to spread my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Court of Justice said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger of lifting his sentence to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the quad@@ ri@@ ads from arch@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the vac@@ ations and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the gym@@ nasi@@ um , four to the secondary school .
school@@ master Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle , who is growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chickens erhof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken egg , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of having a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders were carrying to w@@ ager .
the Adler stands for integration , said School Director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished everyone quad@@ rup@@ ed to feel accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a word of thank@@ fulness to colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps in with school@@ girls and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time now was over , the classroom teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
after two years of teaching , she was very reluct@@ ant to leave her students because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four@@ ths wat@@ chers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end all students had a song of summer time and holiday time to be heard .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight original wat@@ chers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV .
in the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia the police arrested a group of illeg@@ ally @-@ arrested people , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partially Euro 6 .
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to each person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its scope .
how long will the retro@@ fits be drawn altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers deliberately do not act on the topic of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long does the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it can be time consuming to get an appointment .
what are mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ tract , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive price drop of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ace advises to wait for sale .

traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with a progressive TV series already announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely ignore the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to make clear her view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cult establishment in the U.S. capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for the past 31 years , W@@ acker has been a City Engineer .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so , taking into account the regular notice periods - is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach acts as an under@@ e building authority for the administration community , the applicant has to provide relevant qualifications .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ ho@@ fen parking space have been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike at around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a city building master .
with Has@@ la@@ chs own building yard and gardening can be re@@ acted flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old@@ town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is right , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder stresses .
in any case , the city forem@@ an bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everything runs above my desk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on long @-@ term employees for care and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker desires : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate but also for the further design of the city .
who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should , according to information from the city of Has@@ lach , have a completed academic degree as a graduate engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and construction planning law .
the municipal construction department is subject to high and civil engineering , structural planning , civil engineering , municipal utility management , urban planning with building yard and urban gardening as well as an under construction law authority , including a heritage protection authority .
bicycle on lines thrown : South @-@ way route closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad tracks in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were severely damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a rose sco@@ oter and a bike rider were witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a tour of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rator would have brought himself into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay in delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the South Tra@@ ins could be guided without obstruc@@ tions .
close to ten people were on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains failed , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study is exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could mi@@ tig@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflamm@@ ations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium leads too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han fav@@ ours a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el @-@ mili@@ eus if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem , which had however been separated , had not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial chromos@@ omes had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria influenced the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; says Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million Po@@ und signed by Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday started , and impressed in the pen &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the premi@@ er league season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four primary obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , the drawing however began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , that are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire from the party headquarters , but no counter @-@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the election @-@ fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the Party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep strikes .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial office of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to give back their mandate to the Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ wins must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and election campaign leader of the Green Party in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD election campaig@@ ner gro@@ ans when the new Hi@@ bbing message reaches the Party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the over@@ step of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; began with the un@@ expectedly significant defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blue eye , more not , the comrades reli@@ ed at the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into th@@ um@@ bs , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
comrades , in the weeks after that , pain@@ stak@@ ingly ra@@ pp@@ ed again .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next precip@@ itation .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communications , he did everything wrong after that , what can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW ab@@ at@@ ement and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for quite some time .
mi@@ ese survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the League over the past few weeks .
the aspir@@ ation of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him give it as they promised by Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz wasn &apos;t at all .
for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ess of the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career opportunities on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but by the country list of the Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens in parliament , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as top candidate in the parliamentary election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding money for local people III
those who want to be rehabili@@ t@@ ated over the years can soon receive support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development on Wednesday were informed about this .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back at what was happening .
since 1991 , there have been remedi@@ ation areas in sens@@ ations .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received the information that there will be a renovation area III . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros were coming from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role whether interest in the planned area is in general interest .
if necessary , the area borders may be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would then be carried out in the framework of the restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory intake would only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the set @-@ up decision should take place as soon as possible , so that in the coming year it can begin with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that each commun@@ e must carry out the fores@@ een preliminary investigations .
it is important to assess and decide when to decide when it will be san@@ iti@@ zed and to what extent .
for the particular property there is also a rehabilitation note in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again get up feeling and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it goes among other things about the structural condition and the refur@@ bish@@ ment views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and residential bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot make money for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location I II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the audience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come to the house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aesthe@@ tist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s data left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was placed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a fork @-@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the deputy commander of naval aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note also adds that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
the recordings provided by TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform , which was under way in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
but to claim their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation , when the presidential airplane ran ahead of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to reduce the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , an official said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential missions . &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , amounts to EUR 24.@@ 380 per flight .
unit Records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study published in 2015 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga kick @-@ off at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still flaw@@ less balance , the fron@@ trun@@ ner of the Second Tennis League has gained a sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to inserts in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ chman , which is still active at the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella , won &apos;t win the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec this season .
the un@@ defeated Chi@@ lean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo yesterday was with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski even at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again press the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , not filling someone from the trainer for Mari@@ us Z@@ ay &apos;s cad@@ re .
how America can hurt the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress contained a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance .
after all , the draft is intended to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then investors of O@@ MV , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea and North Stream 2 , are al@@ armed accordingly .
the dr@@ one scene is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should even raise the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could fend off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red on Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series of charts
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not gone over for a long time .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one got their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization in the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i Kar@@ tell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

role Back@@ ward : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock turns back in the urban day@@ care centers .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is kept out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cooled .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kitesur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who attend 45 hours of the week eat lunch in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies to 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , add salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , giving the food out , cleaning and cleaning the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seventh @-@ section facilities - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm , which it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city as the most economical one , it says from the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly with some 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eled during the elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed down the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who kept up with friends at Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow is committed to managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which , alongside other products , produces hob@@ bies and R@@ ich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s manager G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insisted on &quot; expressing concern that financing for modernis@@ ing production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross are deeply concerned by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Glasgow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greater Glasgow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic production down@@ fall , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the store manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga may interest you in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t let N@@ ey@@ mar be prosec@@ uted after having given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record attack ?
the sensational approach adopted the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but has the football world been warned three years ago by the President of the PS@@ G before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all the clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area around Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right .
the tour operator tou@@ red the control plan .
there was no damage to the car on the passenger car .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann believes .
the final report on the abuse scandal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; explained after publication in relation to the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Works master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful for the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their mis@@ conception of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was measured when reporting about violence in the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regards to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future . however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation &quot; is remarkable , as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of nam@@ ing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church and that &apos;s a missing fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must guard Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment Authority Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of assault between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more intense .
in contrast to many other accus@@ ations , however , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. estimates and that in many cases even positive memories can be combined with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal caused by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ mis@@ es of Viol@@ ence in Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more tangible when a cathedral treas@@ ury did not produce top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not occur at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence .
you can only repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - as liter@@ al - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent certificate , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only sk@@ ate with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ files and all too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys put on the hair or ears , he himself already promised years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period of time , in the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um .
compared to what it is all about in this report , namely the horri@@ fying sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , it is certainly bag@@ at@@ balls .
one wonders whether it is not rather with his publicity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media in connection with the report , much about the topic abuse was reported in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any involvement or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was all very embarrass@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed it this way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective cul@@ pr@@ its .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that ... Bu@@ ben were more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display .
therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the reporting and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , a mis@@ use of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and , we say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally sh@@ ed@@ ged and mal@@ adjusted , and suffered horri@@ bly , were all acquired at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the cathedral sp@@ lash @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed such a much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ ic &quot; conditions .
what was different from the cathedral sp@@ lash @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline already , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. &quot; and that in many cases even positive memories are combined with him . &quot;
at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then back in 1993 .
do Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral sp@@ ade , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they acquired themselves in a legal grey zone , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis states that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ acy of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and not for what was imposed in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls .
that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally getting up .
but at the same time I have to take protection Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , to pull ear files and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test penalty also come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I would not at all deny that he had a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even that must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally @-@ known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and candy alone , one does not even make a great singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good person , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly a little bit .
I regularly get in contact with him , like many former cathedral @-@ cats today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , to visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today are grateful to him for having enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to whom they still look up and honor them today .
and please , once more clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that lies behind it , all too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has earned great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , probably nobody knows the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , would finally be in peace .
