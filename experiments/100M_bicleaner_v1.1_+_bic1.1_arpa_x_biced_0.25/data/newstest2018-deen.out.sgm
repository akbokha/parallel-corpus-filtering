<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows everyone who has had to get upset because the car-nai instead of a strapping road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but especially very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called urination sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying business.</seg>
<seg id="19">The manuscript for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was registered 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered hallways from the so-called "Big recording," derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots are no more farmers today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October test, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based circular madhouse" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden initiated the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and for example ended the Ankle of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbids the personnel to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenal in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of TSV München East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "children's house was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenberg, which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" "" "Main Square" "", "the Kaufinger street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel dating back to the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days take place and on April 5, 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the Advancement of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur in the whole country and be noted here," it says in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recently adopted Law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state which disproportionately targets minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning," "" "said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are served 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring some chewing money or letting the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report program, which classifies the state in terms of the number of injuries on the country's 16th.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws forcing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischerbacher Weidewatering" "" "project is a successful project and will continue next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the square yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU town association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals looked after and housed in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwald milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also chairman of the" "" "Fischbach" "", "he described the electric fence project as" "" "essential." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I can't profitably manage on such steep faces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area ensures a lot of work, a lot must be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to bring their business further," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of wheat spells.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the durability of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job without farmers and landwives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state funding of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the area to be fenced cannot be tractor-controlled (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing industry in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence for almost 16 kilometres, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space equals 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans like this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imiteers would have liked him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to enter here a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, the miserable rubbish of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about America's importance.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives who bring the American flame to the nazzy world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not light the way, but light the hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain from the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captains "speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range driver Muir goes on this path and last year he set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics about Facebook: do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped in criticism, confident.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union sued it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is why the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news show "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence protestors.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters hit his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers making Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, were overwhelmed by the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>

<seg id="411">The most common items that have been deliberately passed by TSA agents were foods and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 per cent said to have knowingly borne objects with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-thousandassa Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far avoided that a portion of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less dazzling figure: the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months Musk has often had more than 500,000 prepositions for the new car, whose extradition was just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk now admits: 63,000 were already withdrawn from the total 518,000 prepositions.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 455,000 of such non-binding reservations are charged, in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla leader does not believe that the cancellation of up to now twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently available per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if there are greater delays, then the binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state-owned environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which had been raised against his previous position in a federal court.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ozone near to earth.</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" "" "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and sponsors tumbled to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer deed book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen along with the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">In addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, besides the former parish church, was also a wonderful courtyard, to which the church or the patroness belonged to it and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage right originated from the early medieval owner's law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In doing so, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two is Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary Church was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm outdated the steeple and half of them collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the remaining Turmzwerg remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Vorsteher Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim resists" has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines is possible at the same time, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are meant to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind force zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a fault.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen participated in the middle of the year, closed the lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of some 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, the City Council gave its green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A concrete part of the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach was installed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three refurbishment bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a rainbow bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons heavy bridge cap on the northern side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a peripheral fortification, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">On top of that the pedestrian path is going to take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special touch of finger has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crabs had to be fished first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collective pastures in the direction of Schramberg the traffic is controlled by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge lines amounts to 700 000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered editions of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars's world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can easily make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team by the wealthy family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources which enable them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success, cheated effectively and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period that runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Despite the fact that Platini is disgraced by the Presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the FFP for the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenue for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be recorded in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (back then 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players, instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cat could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments made by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WWM will become an ambassador and simply be able to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to bypass the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars's arrival a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1173">The Swiss company has been distributing chocolate bars on board of its flights since 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, as the public prosecutor's office told Constance on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">During the same raids in Italy two people were arrested.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators participated in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 police officers were employed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">Members of the Mafia are accused of organised crime criminality, serious violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutor in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a large building in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot size apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage eye Moull lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of art of engineering went into it," "" "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's important, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have succeeded in enlarging the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and that can help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "Erfan says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard into something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate-imperialist Victorias worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - written by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality "in the De LUTIS family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of concern for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first JeansShop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna de LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to submit their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, where Colin claims that mark has been paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are said," "" "Paul" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin kept himself back, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I can't really say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trump plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to fix: poor information that gets into the president's hands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were too convincing," "" "said former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep track of twitter accounts under control, according to six former election campaigns, insists that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that the" "" "Twitter habit" "" "has ever been" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officers know what others do not know - that Trumpets dumps without their interventions have yet to contain even more combustibles.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump Kontroversen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for Schikanen, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has criticised false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper ram." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys' mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not uncontroversial at the time of the council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof we have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for some time, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out.</seg>

<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broadly positioned, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both vacationers, groups or businesspeople should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump, special promoters Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee accepted the work over the past few weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between the Comelection campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation should focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also magnified more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump had personally moved to the centre and accused the accusation of whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in potential crimes and to decide whether to impose charges." ""</seg>

<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor's office in order to pre-charge persons for the interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were already issued, which revolved around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">"" "" "" "people who were involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement, called it in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., also Trump counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election leader Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the substitution will show that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the suspension of the parliament was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this way, it was said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this ejection, accusations against Trump have become noisy, he has hindered justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey spoke before a Senate committee in June, Trump asked him to set up the investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After portraying US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair, the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest iron giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research information, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the eruption of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis until now.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and cancellations was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete coward there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It's a good idea that the Larsen-C-Shoe file is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks off at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice-ice and ice-berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can lead straight into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only very little, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelei is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists we argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis would now grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "" "Our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these scientists do not trace the departure of this giant iceberg to climate change, however, in recent decades many ice-yards of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus tame to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house-tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to step out of the Employers' Association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the circle day marked 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses at the circle are obviously highly coveted.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were about 620 applications for the places to be published this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 vacant positions at the Mettmann circuit.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop" "" "a concept for personnel recruitment and human resources development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the candidate shortage in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show specific measures for cross entrants and include an educational initiative, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees who leave out of the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">High time for action so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He caused a big surprise in the circle day for a big surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and struck the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "peoples want all the possibilities to be checked which permit a withdrawal from the local employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't come short-term to a satisfactory solution, the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - a hoof-tariff," "" "said the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money is only when you change to a higher level, which is geared towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone on NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean to prevent them from continuing to adopt new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes on board the crew of rubber dinghy, which are delivered directly to traffickers, and that smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting reportedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overexposed by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles, rather than compete in wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-Sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high staffs included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognised the first Bundesligavereine which is increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German embassy to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or just the FIFA soccer simulation games are being challenged at the level of competition.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Lists have long established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in Asia's 2022 e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is this a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has long been confronted with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classic sports - for example elevated heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">I also need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction ability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW leader said the company said that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a call back.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers, systems for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles, also increase, which makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plotting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so-called write-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but to drive back under normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughing," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he suggested, among other things, as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After several stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60's: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble into drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to him, he is still sitting at the drawing table, working daily almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches his droll characters continue to spread widely worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminding of drought and disease-transferring insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, the expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small cicade, a microbial bacterium that transmits the dwarf-cads, and in very dry weather there are a lot of it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts tourists not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shade of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated by the Committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and although the terrain is still more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we all mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the road every day or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have upset the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxication problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-sounding investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever she went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life" "", "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love to the routine of his calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 per cent of the policemen that the Governor referred to as being untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposes on government spending, focusing on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor's Office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about preceding events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few characters and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on salaries and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day the director Bojorquez runs away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger violated her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well preserved condition has astounded researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth-pump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterclavation, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better mix himself into his surroundings and evade his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with care.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were driven by carnivorous dinosaurs by carnivorous dinosaurs that the evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nostalaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, who became a camping area when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson do not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferré's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, who after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one can say a bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or simply "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will stop at the beginning of the construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, as the rent there are often not tradable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the farmer's market hall supposed to be during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually actually comes.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after having publicly classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2nd August, is called A Becoming resemblance (a fitting resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline unified her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form of DNA-data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six offences against the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stuffing and chewing gum to extract the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained mice became unequal pounds, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a cartoon illustrating "Suppressed images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president of Chelsea would translate judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a little deeper and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump uses a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to further flame the rigid splits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things are going to happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her surname is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishing similar, at least in biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and Detective investigates the engravings as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem is Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to respect the code that describes the criteria for the reintegration of RUSADA and recently published on the website of the organization.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company do not become the next user</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to be lucky with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," Errett said, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people out of the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographical groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow managers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have most of the ailments and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of workplace culture, so that you will not become the next person involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment, in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the finanztech website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Scent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As GLINT, Convercent enables you to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethic, values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Scent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">With $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, glitters secured his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only possible.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools promise to increase third party commitment and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotify clerks.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, staff ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem relates to GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company will always have new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to better binding of employees in a branch known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshire man with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says melancholy." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Bridges May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so angry with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my Welcome greetings") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">"" "guys, let's go all his gear!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell designed from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed quite gauner, always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"" "other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to promote revenue." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government, the five vice-ministers, as well as the Minister of Defence, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the consultations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government moves the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the air forces and the navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup attempt, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wirepuller of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara for this week.</seg>

<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan fired another 7395 government servicers, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals formerly considered the real masters of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a great thing right now.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepper woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adjusted to your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, restless one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy then?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its origins and increasing sophistication point towards something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain tentatively on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the edge-zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots show up at a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the curved body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, at the point when it comes to their personalities, the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are false slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid Service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps deliver great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly harassing all of us to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticeable is the power of Trump to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denser who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it coincides with another connection that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bibs of one day will no longer be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republics of the right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatising music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since here two two-year-olds, an 11-year old and two women can go on it in the 40-s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically gripping, while I was tired of the experience to spread my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention, this time against the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appel, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Court of Justice said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is in danger of lifting his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The job is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For the past 31 years, Wacker has been a City Engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him, as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>

<seg id="2542">So, taking into account the regular notice periods - is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as an undere building authority for the administration community, the applicant has to provide relevant qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study is exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could mitigate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium leads too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan favours a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel-milieus if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem, which had however been separated, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial chromosomes had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria influenced the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then carried out small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2864">The site of La Liga may interest you in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't let Neymar be prosecuted after having given an offer of £189 million to release his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach adopted the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans Board insists that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But has the football world been warned three years ago by the President of the PSG before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34 year old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW arrived at 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann believes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," explained after publication in relation to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Works master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their misconception of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican magazine" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "was measured when reporting about violence in the cathedral-cats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regards to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future. however, the "degree of medial manipulation" is remarkable, as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of naming the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we would like to go to the church and that's a missing fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "strikes were a very normal educational tool" "" "to deal with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must guard Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Ezemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the findings of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Authority Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of assault between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "", "67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other accusations, however, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. estimates and that in many cases even positive memories can be combined with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal caused by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Premises of Violence in Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist who became more tangible when a cathedral treasury did not produce top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger does not occur at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of non-violence at the preschool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can only reproach him, experience it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as literal -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent certificate, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only skate with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear-files and all too naughty boys put on the hair or ears, he himself already promised years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period of time, in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is all about in this report, namely the horrifying sexual abuse and the excesses of non-violence at the preschool, it is certainly bagatballs.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not rather with his publicity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report, much about the topic abuse was reported in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any involvement or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "said a affected representative for the others," "" "I was all very embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student expressed it this way: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective culprits.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that... Buben were more intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the reporting and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere in the middle of George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is, in turn, a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence and, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally shedged and maladjusted, and suffered horribly, were all acquired at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the cathedral splash-gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses stress, the subject" "" "preschool" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed such a much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacic" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the cathedral splash-gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline already, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimated the general humanity of R." and that in many cases even positive memories are combined with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral spade, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the preschool, the test penalty will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test fines were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they acquired themselves in a legal grey zone, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis states that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "fallacy of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and not for what was imposed in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very awful and I'm glad that it's finally getting up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take protection Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and punishment, to pull ear files and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "did Georg Ratzinger play in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test penalty also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the Domspatzen only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I would not at all deny that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally-known Regensburger Domspatzen, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, one does not even make a great singer from rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good person, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do a fly a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in contact with him, like many former cathedral-cats today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, to visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen today are grateful to him for having enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to whom they still look up and honor them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that you reproach him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
