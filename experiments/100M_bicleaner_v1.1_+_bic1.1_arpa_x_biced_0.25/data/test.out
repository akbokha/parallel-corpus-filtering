28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local grocery store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , sharing the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , announced the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a chef in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this hard time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a stated that Frank first lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way to connect with his family was to always cook us something to prepare dinner for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit bri@@ ghtly each day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the sign @-@ up phone of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or getting stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have no desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , she asks the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not need to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film starts with us on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger studied with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid of sports &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they ch@@ ased home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that was the end of the riding career .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was once again close to horses .
he let himself run over the complex of the AL@@ RV with his family , on a horse he did not even s@@ well for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala the Golden World Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ bury leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is a long time .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting young people .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the exhibitors are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ver , the owner Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the show@@ room , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump want to .
however , the two US presidential candidates are at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical differences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself would be quite different , preten@@ ding Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely drive back regulations and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money .
for this reason , taxes for the rich would be increased , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both of them are very close to the topic infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be invested in that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost verb@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could still be party @-@ internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and re@@ boot coal mining in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to quit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment programme , Clinton , on the other hand , intends to extend and demand renew@@ ables : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ icious trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid better then , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months seems likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , there is a tr@@ ump that wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , is paying more taxes and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each has a baby at most one year old .
one has put her small son in her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and focuses on women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as a visitor .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other reasons for the escape of women : &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes that when they come to Germany , you are mistaken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are trau@@ mati@@ sed and appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children were certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , they need more accommodations only for them , demand B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
some people say no to the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for instance , there is no such thing in the housing of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , wing@@ ed women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or will men and women be accommod@@ ated together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and readily accessible for women .
how much women feel this need for protection can be read on the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever since he has spoken about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
veter@@ in@@ arians strike : demands for new campaign measures
Sub@@ stitute veter@@ in@@ arians have called their union to appro@@ ve new campaign measures in their disputes about a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more campaign measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chair@@ woman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , leading to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating campaign measures starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that in six times assistant doctors quar@@ rel@@ ed six times , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced forci@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes up his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his re@@ taining relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly by his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was kind@@ led .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
restoring the ve@@ to becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report written in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the slu@@ g emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ amor@@ ous palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have rejected and treated badly by the West and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even interfer@@ ed with the topic .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey poured the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State should at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the head of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and stock exchange will be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand , as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives .
each of these brands will stand in their own congreg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already pointed out that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , as how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

on Friday Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he takes the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few achieved before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already caught 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drug prohibition .
three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his top form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to an end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue his career at competitions up to a minimum of five years .
Russian Putin smo@@ kes Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for the Environment and Transport Issu@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov was ordered by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in Tall@@ inn , Estonia , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state in terms of bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was , for a long time , one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff rec@@ edes at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at present .
but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - met with skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated item - you could almost say - post @-@ bur@@ den@@ some post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest allies Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday .
on the set there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents is written out , are expected to be published at a later date according to ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart &apos;s blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals decorated by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
business Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the deck de@@ cks at their place and the last section of the deck are getting a d@@ ong@@ ation for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure is future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or shore side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances that the team worked towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown off fishing boat off Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at struck at 13 : 20 on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and set the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the sea rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today w@@ akes up over these men .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get his personal stuff .
instead , the alcoholic dis@@ sec@@ ts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and body .
the police could arrest the perpetrators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 year old took his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be obliged much more strongly in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home for Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , you have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas but as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development program that will cost millions and still needs to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann , the situation on the housing market is sharpen@@ ed .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the professionals .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing back apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the western city , dead@@ lines are coming out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased again , the aim of the so @-@ called mixing @-@ mix is to be removed .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are not going to play outside but prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the United States , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ bur@@ dened .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the car and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tra@@ cked by 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of watched people who exercise 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; stum@@ ble on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who exercise regularly , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on hunting .
as always , there are also m@@ ica players who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , healthier and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is definitely immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
brilliant on whole line .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast died on Thursday for the championship title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tournaments during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multiple battle title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has over the past three years dominated their sport , 15 world championships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other , after winning gold and silver in the single majority of women in the artificial tur@@ ne during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long way to the top never to have planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves .
suspended beam and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world title - lau@@ ded .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended beam - and sat on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man sof@@ tly embra@@ ced her as she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old male capit@@ ol , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a margin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her exercise , she threw Kus@@ sh@@ ands to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial kill@@ ings while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous fall of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the cul@@ pri@@ t fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y attack , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in his@@ panic resi@@ ding within four months and two were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the factory of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ cephal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself sit on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can help with a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something before me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional cost of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have demanded tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the A@@ mite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fron@@ tier in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams sent people out of the floo@@ ding water in the A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight .
he said that another step @-@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ cked and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high state of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed up to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were heavy rain@@ falls , and that the authorities might consider ev@@ ac@@ uation directives .
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground was largely su@@ c@@ tioned by rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 houses flooded .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which now both were flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags provided for the residents who hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ ding , but no reported on Friday until now .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police tells that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was admitted to hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter with the fact that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ age @-@ sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were shells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area met .
there was no arrest and the police were re@@ port@@ edly re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross@@ bar when she played in front of her house in West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America ju@@ bel@@ te .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they gave unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes all over the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ n@@ astic primarily in private gym@@ n@@ astic associations which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel - clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and their families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both of their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities the inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training .
I have founded my foundation of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international champi@@ ons .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors would like to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute about the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to introduce the agreement and said that the N@@ HS had been in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance v@@ ets are said to have a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the maintenance of day @-@ to @-@ day hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current occupation crisis and it will be fo@@ amed to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve the disputes caused by discussions have imp@@ acted the government for reluct@@ ance , and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise awareness and address the concerns of assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work @-@ action measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute about the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials .
the BM@@ A wants a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour campaign measures do not achieve anything but burden our stressed teams and service providers and prepare the patients , care providers and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we spoke to the assistant doctor &apos;s tea and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries positively on concerns about gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower .
employers hoped that continuing positive engagement with other key topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the conventions with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls forming plaque .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the pipeline design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s provisional recommendation we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on account of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption King , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside elec@@ ting cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a document to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only needs to call his name and address .
the report proposes applying non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when submitting their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should keep more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral scandal in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the current mayor of Lut@@ fur was to be removed from the corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a lit@@ any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have conducted &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of mail - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including the leading of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , in particular women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... governmental institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists work in post @-@ electoral documents to stop &quot; harvesting elections . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition of political activ@@ ist to process complete envel@@ opes and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs to set up elec@@ tive stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in the law , facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation according to the 1983 repression of the People Act 1983 .
no photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the constitu@@ encies ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go alone in the voting cabin .
Sir Eric goes over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tive court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices because of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town councils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud legacy , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gers and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio arrived this week by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of the border and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ se@@ ater of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic ik@@ in is by far not the only athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger , not the only athlete capable of giving faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides Kate &apos;s doppel@@ gan@@ ger on the cycling race many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street star sne@@ ak@@ ily similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ an@@ ity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big , expressive eyes , is supposed to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool basin the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a further prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who shows similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans to the same &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter Schauspiel@@ er@@ Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the American football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese swimming in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as M@@ ief , he died like a pig .

Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many were talking about him
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets all of us look like ra@@ cists .
shortly thereafter , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swim performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in people who replied to the B@@ emer@@ ken about Twitter
comment@@ ator Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers yesterday night and ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers in the social media .
to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing in the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming relay in the C@@ BC Olympic program , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ t to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back to the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before putting her back to the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rose again and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , drew their own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put it back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , attracted and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home trousers which had another person and that were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn your predat@@ or around the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from the back then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee in the l@@ ath and twist the weapon out of his hands , while the attack@@ er cl@@ ut@@ ches from his hands . beat him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the gun out of its handle before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is most secure to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and th@@ rows of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k cut off his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before finishing each object , he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea of removing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to fl@@ ushing buttons of toilets , the task put his immune system defini@@ tively below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a kid I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud @-@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test sample showed a lumin@@ ance number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off , after their lum@@ bar number@@ ing amounted to more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the movie he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others with which it was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social housing destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left its social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , employees of the apartment cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be regarded as not as nice part of the walls of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn
neighbours told them that they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ im@@ ited them and their partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family would have agreed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ laid side of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ o@@ cation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information we have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti@@ social behaviour will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ cation on the floor .
house administration workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found himself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial law .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many carp@@ enters of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not adhere to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach and those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after a military jet is flying over

a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ force Air@@ force made an incredible dive
the air@@ strikes indicated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a jet over a full beach gets crashing down .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up as they understood understand@@ ably to worry about the noise of the nozzle without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ by in social media said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people died in Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which restricted his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Ma Long in an own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 year old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ ranking first brought the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes in World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they with@@ drew on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ est@@ ants on one another in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches to this place for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really batt@@ led with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected exciting match .
nevertheless , there were enough breath @-@ taking ball@@ ads to see .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had a ri@@ pple injury , after that , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte at the same time .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &apos; huge problems &apos; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced such concerns as correspon@@ dents said .
having thrown up 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , there are now doubts about his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt were false reports of his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sch@@ isms .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey carried out by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tr@@ ump and his c@@ ousin of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were in balance .
other institutions see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are endangered as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like I &apos;ve done it so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and ask afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than telling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not reach the end for reasons of political correctness , it is al@@ right , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to withdraw funds to support its campaign , it should not be able to present better results .
instead of this , the candidate of the Republi@@ cans wants to get stronger under the arms of Congress .
Olympia : three @-@ day fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face disaster after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at the Olympic Village in Kenya , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function had indicated that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , submitted a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson red in the Olympic village .
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the International Association of IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case to test its own investigations , announced an IA@@ AF spokesman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following IO@@ C measures , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ uson red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Wood@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing World Cup fourth in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ er , was withdrawn from Rio Games .
he is alleged to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences , the IO@@ C has been under special surveillance for some time now .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya adopted the list of countries whose dop@@ ing comb@@ ating con@@ forms with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television report of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing drugs in Kenya are easily accessible and there should be a substantial mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this type of sport the surface area was lo@@ oped and systematically supp@@ ressed .
athletes of Russia were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled herself with the role of Maria a youth space .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her boy@@ hood with Tony while the younger sister plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
she is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli gives back the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British ma@@ ids who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from east London went to a plane heading to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have been blocking Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell is the opinion that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; choose &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a Rei@@ d spokesperson said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocking the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , are mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes us because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to release the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community pays off with mass flight
&quot; those who are not adapting themselves to Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ ds community of Germany is expecting a short time with tens of thousands of refugees seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already crossed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal charges already months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will start re@@ starting in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that welcomes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Union compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities .
that means that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or driven over the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President demanded that the Federal Government positions itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is held . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who are not adapting themselves to Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alist and sa@@ wing , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum seekers accepted in Germany because of political persecution .
as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey there are not those who are worthy of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they have understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
it is more stupid than it has so far : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ election campaign - that bites itself .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on vacation .
most holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang out posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up votes in the end , only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last resort day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again leave the election campaign just close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , just started .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
what is exciting will be how much Neul@@ ing Af@@ D will cut off and what remains at the end of a coalition &apos;s day .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his great posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the p@@ eg@@ rowing of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ stens the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is probably going to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make electoral campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major documents ; Merkel &apos;s federal elec@@ torate is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign boo@@ ths on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to co@@ ke , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country , you crum@@ bling the ground@@ work that it must be very demanding to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the council of the CD@@ U @-@ winner Kok@@ ert on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , Golden weddings , every birthday celebration needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called up his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and make their election campaign largely online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it calls the national president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go to search for native vocal ch@@ ats among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am and ending at 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything will be ready .
there will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of cabin cru@@ ises .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is restored , the traffic situation within the resort has eased .
the citizens can now drive on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the pass traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many det@@ ours were looking and more familiar with their na@@ vi than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality encouraged the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made herself aware of the situation on the spot .
two to three per minute have been spent .
the fastest route was at 77 hours per hour in the speed 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lear@@ ner is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds explicit words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of sales revenues , it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his staff have to be released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half were dismissed , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now , they also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
the fact that other regular guests are now less frequently passing by because of complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his pedi@@ gree returns to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising either .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals not yet to be made with the SPD : he wants to place sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ cks off jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they have , in part , in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are deliberately brought to the country need to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such that commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some of these are still un@@ plu@@ gg@@ able and are open to questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with people were not cl@@ inging out in election times .
internal security has been greatly moved into focus .
just the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the two parties tou@@ red high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ den@@ ier dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a burn @-@ out and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have limited the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ juven@@ ate , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show himself .
there is a lot in that which could cause quar@@ rels .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ strate themselves on the subject of internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to further improve security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
despite diesel engines , delivery volumes are rising worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
there is confusion about a term in the recall action .
Volkswagen starts deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel generation , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer continues to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
however , in July the core brand VW weakened above all in Western Europe and again stressed the total sales , as the company noted in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s figure .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales fell 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
deliveries were delivered by almost one sixth in the home market of Germany .
sales of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann declined the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a purchase restra@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust gas initially escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus sign .
the Chinese market is a great support for VW .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony has already got off lightly anyway by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only 0.@@ 9 percent of vehicles will be available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles after the first seven months .
group sales of the group Fred Kap@@ pler continued with a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust system .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops .
in the course of conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after re@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate from the car , the car manufacturer does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for modified diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
this meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA Complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the warranty that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deterior@@ ations occur after retro@@ fitting and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen can see the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage does not have anything to do with it .
even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste scandal will result in uncertainty about possible warranty claims as it was said .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from wealthy savers in future pen@@ al interest rates - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are storing money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al interest .
this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund starting in September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been keeping 40 million euros for quite some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and that he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of the cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs now continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , for this the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is a little more luxuri@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she has free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gen@@ ossen@@ schaften bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known to any other banks that charge a pa@@ yout for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the neg@@ atives vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in terms of width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
l@@ one middle @-@ aged men love boards .
before making ha@@ ste to comment on him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Al@@ le@@ One &apos;s middle @-@ aged men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ birth of records is not caused by a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after ages 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and gra@@ zing wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something like this : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly embra@@ cing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle aged , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy it me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink so much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and were forced to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection as a rule by 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a specific age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like ph@@ onica to see record stores offering a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received impetus on the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar noise plate covers , from objects that wake up happy mood memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee stands out of a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pol@@ l of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I leaf@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it happens definitely .
more product @-@ less , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I am entering .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ be@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz is re@@ conc@@ iled from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the psychological trauma is hard to determine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it &apos;s more a window @-@ shopping than a wholesale purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while giving the impression that jeans pants pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of Soh@@ o could send for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research sur@@ rendered that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they un@@ accounted for at least in stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with a stroll through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they steer clear of the star@@ tling look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , who raises no clu@@ e middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects proposal on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to supp@@ ress 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and solidarity .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants appreciated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp was rising to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his disap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic times , Rad@@ professional Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get enter@@ tained .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on the schedule of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in silence the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
at the world championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to be rehabili@@ t@@ ated bridges with temporary speed poli@@ shing , there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary flash for compl@@ ying with speed limits .
however , a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
reinforcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days at un@@ interrupted operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as drive b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved with trailer hit@@ ch to the trailer according to the manufacturer .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear without a safe outer hull .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the flash from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used .
even foreign authorities blitz@@ ten with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain catches silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class takes gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is in the final on Thursday evening when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago , R@@ yan lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one thing .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji turned out to be wonderful and gave the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving coaches . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au stayed in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a h@@ ul@@ tuous T@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute S@@ em@@ al@@ ua turned a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ appointment and there was still more than a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by other weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while still learning GB .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova passed through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounds , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the UK ki@@ cked off cr@@ ushing into the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by a fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was ever present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who laid such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9th uns@@ ul@@ led application , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al go@@ ose .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more assistant than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ stri@@ cken morning talking about it more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t get a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to en@@ close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much in the moment .
Hel@@ en cried , &quot; Le@@ ave in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was called the &quot; Bavarian Radio &quot; ( Bavarian Radio ) .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the association staff , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land acquisitions in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and the compensation of farmers , the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the high @-@ tank ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and there are always new additions , because water life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over the course of 31 years .
he has established himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe on nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , his part , praised water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal scar@@ let .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose @-@ association .
however , the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest effort was the demoli@@ tion at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ hö@@ fer on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease was known by her son , she believed that she should die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago is well ahead and now is studying privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which is two years back when I sang at La Scala , he doesn &apos;t remember anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ on Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shoots to life @-@ mate
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him I will be publicly punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
but it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he can still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck at first did not want to make any information about the rule of the crime or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - flash@@ point for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green power funding are from the table .
it remains at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion at the existing plants for so @-@ called own power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry also threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions law trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate , as the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat eased .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have risen .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
the Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month after each other .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of Deutsche Seni@@ oren@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also made this experience in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
for this , senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing .
he who demands his lungs regularly , even in everyday life , doesn &apos;t get out of the chest as quickly as possible .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Community of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia are sin@@ king back to long @-@ standing events .
when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are thus practicing not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows by singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior ench@@ ant@@ or , one can easily join .
many cities also provide insights into the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can direct themselves directly to the church or the chur@@ ch@@ war@@ den .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to scre@@ ams of the kit@@ tens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the fen of kit@@ tens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also didn &apos;t let the males cool - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in the difference to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of kit@@ tens in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of kit@@ tens who are in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out .
K@@ ater also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten scre@@ am was different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ation of little ones that were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ tens that were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who have not yet their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speakers , when this rep@@ ut@@ ation of the very excited kit@@ tens played out .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males ever re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise several times in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is again taking place an important football match .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency came to an end after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens , was not affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
this doesn &apos;t stop before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Str@@ ong Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar .
according to this , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ ar is said to be the suppor@@ ter of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
it is true that the exceptional state imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ watch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan shut@@ down on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas Wor@@ ker Club traditionally do not belong to the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Turks on the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive particularly in Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ me@@ g Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season @-@ hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ conserv@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was contracted by AC Florence , had only been announced after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; commented the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
in order to do this , however , the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual salary at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova can &apos;t start in Rio .
other deceived athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ line for the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who compla@@ ined about a dop@@ ing barrier in front of the games shortly before the games , was plu@@ gged off mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 m breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal setting : she was still in the hall with a smile on her face and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was established that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience went out into a ju@@ bel@@ lish .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past during the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to sit down six months after winning the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , world champion in 2013 and European championships , was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied entry and was closed for six months .
the four wi@@ dest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and have been locked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible for mar@@ ching mar@@ ching .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognised as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone dop@@ ing was established .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
the also recognized bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games was awarded due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record female and gold favorite was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran off already on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Multiple deaths
the Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday early .
she had suffered car@@ ving wounds and had been treated in the hospital but had already left it again .
her home trip was scheduled for early September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a life @-@ life district .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another human being was killed , according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach in Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast required several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but it is probably the act of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in the past few days the authorities would have received intelligence evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they would not have been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
the police noted their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bomb attacks , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bombs explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , the necessary trips to these provinces will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , re@@ port@@ edly considers itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the violent rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , some 20 people were killed in Bangkok on a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional Compla@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national em@@ b@@ assi@@ es , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation also provided the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional head of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are treated in extrem@@ ist ways .
this is why we are now watching the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; identity spheres &quot; already observe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a young language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a convenient advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there had been reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase of right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be ri@@ ghtful structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that other ri@@ gh@@ tist groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of sp@@ elling @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were worried that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum hol@@ dings have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or voted for example the CD@@ U , the SPD or the left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ hau@@ led s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia came so slowly that at times it was no longer visible in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently turned into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special charter from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
because most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
fast the first nick@@ names made the turn .
some media referred to him as the &quot; ru@@ ble of whale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ free style , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the Swimming @-@ Team from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of open @-@ air .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the im@@ pending election defeat not so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there &apos;s nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video .
he then drive into the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sales to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokesman on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are shipped , also to sell to other farms .

GF@@ RP guidance replaces disap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K suggests that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again disap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company leadership , the worldwide number five of the industry faces a personnel new start .
GF@@ RP Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as of September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the former Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , sharing the company with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the position of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details didn &apos;t want to mention a company spokesman on Friday .
it is unclear who will be conducting market research activities in the future .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ kreis , on Friday , the shareholders &quot; disappointment was the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K lace since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the latest bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent , with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
earnings in the second quarter , above all , imp@@ acted the company &apos;s sun@@ ken value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s sales tot@@ als of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , contributed to the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K still managed to generate a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , condemned the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to give way to an opposite truck , which was partly driving on the back road .
the bus stopped right off the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns district of P@@ ew@@ lett .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter waste amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high rate of calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the district council Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that under@@ cover for these wastewater facilities .
due to legal foundations , the village of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ effective manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from the world of Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to dig deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be compensated .
Schmidt thus justified the serious fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , for example , costs for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to their age refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair costs , all three plants have fallen into a considerable extent , not least due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that in the Az@@ endorf wastewater system the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced as a result of damage .
the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl had to recover from the ground almost 20 years old and during the Lop@@ p pond wastewater treatment plant , the first clari@@ fication pond had to be dischar@@ ged , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued assistance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still under the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water inf@@ estation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , added to the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water systems , has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
in the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association could not be expanded because these facilities are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , compared to a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices stayed as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past when they were accused of promoting the app &apos;s black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed a filter to some users this week , which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and abandoned che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were spread widely on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous and yellow said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osi@@ tion of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ resistant , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the sc@@ rap@@ ing extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration campaign , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case before , &quot; said K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors working there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ stituted population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu , on his part , said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence service information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a review committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Coun@@ cil@@ ors Commit@@ tees , Secret Service Commit@@ tees and the military budget committee , reported great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ sus , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence gathering information that was typically endor@@ sed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders recorded regularly a positive image of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans sum@@ mon@@ ed the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights and will be continued during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway through the Ministry of Defense &apos;s general inspec@@ tor .
democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the Committee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damages the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at the Cent@@ com analysts in terms of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon chief inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to the complaints of Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still ongoing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , fores@@ aw little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same place in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we can rip the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand blow from the close range .
India went into the game without a victory , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who had to book one gate in each of the previous games so far .
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well is the result of the next game hanging on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen des tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ le guard to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympics and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline tournament .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swim and may it rule for a long time .
but if I would like to make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many people I had inter@@ viewed did not know that it is an Olympic athlete at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds more fitting for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but rather an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the spar@@ se trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , holding and Sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are assessed according to the type , level of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold farther , faster , upward and upward , sometimes to the goal , sometimes to the goal , sometimes to the top and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also the TV transmission also another high goal : that of the world or the Olympic record .
the goal @-@ directed aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ gling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gym@@ na@@ sts recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal recently - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is waiting for his new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last decade , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more regions .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses indicated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable rate .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents being sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor wear to stran@@ gle@@ hold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess erup@@ t after years of drinking pi@@ ety under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians told them that they gathered so much to the protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ er dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , representing about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and policy .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was considered tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to analysts , seemingly deceived by the government and were then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but it is obvious that this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government &apos;s internal mis@@ understanding .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred for the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently communicated that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , was not meant seriously .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gently with the American public .
it also brings his fellow @-@ workers who try to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump drew back with reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sts in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism r@@ att@@ les Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s email , but later he explained &quot; Natur@@ ally , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what reaction happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone since its survey results declined further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent spokes@@ men of Tr@@ ump@@ ur , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it am@@ bushes , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by attacking the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around and bi@@ ased on each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies as just another proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which was replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people suffered as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and club is now a soap shop . &quot;
but when New York change is , it is also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Cafe Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new out@@ source , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed aside by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the club closed , she gave her coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she placed a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarter to seven , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
indeed , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he intends to make them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building .
for many customers a new club is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies at Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; published by Har@@ per Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ zzy snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ney , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked pie for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of the land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and br@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ covering food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noted Bri@@ ck@@ man , as coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a seldom servi@@ ced luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a high @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home service recipes .
like never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - are the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publi@@ ci@@ zing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become household policy makers and to transform the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Essen , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa country house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ heavy man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to post@@ p@@ one an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the arrival of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was used on food .
in writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall incident .
after clearing the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew out a dessert they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved a little reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad .
CO@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even with a drum bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and provide first aid in the war zone .
they are heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Defence , showing him a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans the shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said in the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think God sees a marty@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ i@@ ders usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ i@@ ders get offspring only with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it counts , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle embos@@ sed by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long suspected that Greenland ha@@ irs will become st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ons measured them , when they left six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard and equipped them with a transmitter .
nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ a@@ vers to tor@@ ch from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ i@@ ders who brought fishermen from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is formed prior to the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons tests , so it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland ha@@ irs , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens core , resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign the length of an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously has at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame @-@ flame .
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows a lot faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more into a long life .
building site in double pack
the council at the latest meeting focuses on topics relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently @-@ proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after clari@@ fying the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and en@@ closing questions and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is no longer possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the council is convinced that the building area in the rural and quiet residential community Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , members of the building will be able to contact the town hall as soon as possible , and the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to also meet requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit , the business area designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial transactions can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it has hitherto been sufficient for them to be approved in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is being used by large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but also breaks down as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the River Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxemburg , No. 19 , Dublin , No. 33 and Paris to 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researchers .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector worked in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was released from a claim payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical acts .
at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US Director at Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck accused each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir weed , active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokesman on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ bing after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council , which was allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earning 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and paying 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Democrats of the Democrats and their husband .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in speech hon@@ ours ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their mandate in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns for the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; stated Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false talks and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business lun@@ ches and various other links , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed into the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals paying more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 tax declaration showed that this was only USD 100 of its income as a salary , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way of keeping eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ des .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years ago , worked together with U.S. natural protection to encourage volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many wood@@ p@@ eck@@ ers used to defend themselves .
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bli@@ ster in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a pop and spray fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air .
a touch is usually sufficient to hunt the elephant .
one last chance is a shi@@ mmer who shoots a gold @-@ turn fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in exposed location on the shores of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director beats Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election since Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he got there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel Management &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the choice be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lanz@@ mann employee was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the internet where people called the whole thing a scandal .
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; given &quot; to the alleged &quot; Arab guests &quot; demands . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a different article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed to Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ffiti against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison between Moscow and Teher@@ an .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies in the country grew strongly in the country , divided the ambassador with .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 was 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
looked for : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest bread
a rob@@ ber @-@ raid was carried out on Thursday evening to the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had slan@@ dered their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash from the employee of the drink market and then fled first to foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited , the police do not share .
the perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and can be viewed poorly .
the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from which gravel parking space located opposite the parking @-@ house entrance can be escaped with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
anyone who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun at summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social @-@ educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their assistants at their summer free time in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet area of leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ ling , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescu@@ ing with the visit of the stro@@ us@@ z@@ oos .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous clo@@ ister .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and car@@ egi@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared body dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were treated to culinary delights .
workshops were made , creating beautiful jewels of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game .
other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of returning home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages had been completed together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage in two years , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St. Anna &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; round of ministers decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage tour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the B@@ ish@@ ops &quot; city of Freiburg , where , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms were on the way .
in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims to St. Anna in a small ceremony , blessed the pilgrims and distributed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b we went by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a ster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and text texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially composed pilgri@@ m song .
for the overnight stays the local par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage guests Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and star@@ tling dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
the next day we went to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of road , but at low heat some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers had to be desc@@ ended and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon of the Freiburg Min@@ ster and crossed the gates of mercy .
God thank@@ ed us with a little impulse .
at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar .
the next day was time for the B@@ reis@@ gau met@@ rop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite won Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . he was proud of the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s withdrawal only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time for the execution .
his retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner put in the qualifying rounds an Olympic record , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn , Hin@@ der was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Beh@@ ind when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ derer admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no acqu@@ it@@ tal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that &apos;s a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in cycle power .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23rd March ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y particip@@ ates next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and is going to go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record won gold in London 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had cont@@ ested yesterday with the commission@@ ers before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB Team relies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a ch@@ ar of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical manager in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying van@@ ces as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when one looks at the first evening of the Vel@@ od@@ rom competition , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs which has reached its peak at the perfect moment could be repeated again .
future of the melting egg of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby aboli@@ sh all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no other subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk at a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa signed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting cheese of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the great aluminum melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p keep smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; which would have come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenue from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry against possible closure of Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts per year and Tom@@ ago consum@@ es some 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted American Vo@@ gue collection .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , cre@@ eping reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the well @-@ known Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ arrest ) , as they forgot the cover of their sister and that ended with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é story of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we forgot you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon kite on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( aut fashi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ disk 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover@@ star is expected to be so addic@@ tive that in the last two years pictures of the magazine might still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , who model@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties , or reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything is applicable to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success does not appeal to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her the Mist@@ ress of the Moment .
these feelings were boiling high again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal coun@@ cill@@ ors aver@@ aged 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell stated that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es showed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rell stated that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately undo these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the Land government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customers , and that the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign accused after collabor@@ ating allegedly weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after having been informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina had shot a gun in February for a staff while on the road in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i gave up to have waited for months for the matter to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the course of Vincent &apos;s Kni@@ ec@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he claimed in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bhagavan said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered an uph@@ eav@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival had to be elected H@@ illary Clinton and ap@@ point judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s campaign clearly showed that the media would have torn down its words from the context and that it would not be offensive to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
b@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of duty of care and of Philip because of body injury and lasting psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press press was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer staff of the campaign .
responding to calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .
the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before EU elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses for the government parties SPD and CD@@ U stand out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had good chances to continue to position the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party only paraly@@ ses just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , the SPD of the survey showed only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still lying behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left by 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would , on the other hand , miss the entry into 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit tor@@ menting slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; cell division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers that all came a lot later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere , this is a day @-@ to @-@ day life for many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion devices sold on Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the tools are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all using touch screen easy to use .
the triumph of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already employ 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will stage ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers had wron@@ ged 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion on wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years later to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it communicated that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop side would change coding with regard to its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the recognition on which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the announ@@ cing open source community and the b@@ ans has been in progress since the invention of scor@@ ners , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indications for the industry have become .
according to a study from last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the adverti@@ sers &quot; ads .
the company has set it apart from ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokesman .
advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue , so that Facebook will make the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be updating its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ enza &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over advertising on them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te way , which is why instead we focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman crossing s@@ wis@@ s highway in case of presum@@ ed suicide
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police sum@@ mon witnesses after a woman was passed on a highway during the early morning hours on Thursday when she suspected of suicide .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was driven over by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these and every witness of the incident promp@@ ts them to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter said to the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - where a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who responded to an emergency call -- ran into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still slowly spinning .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protect from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus expon@@ enti@@ ates its day @-@ to @-@ day sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution , which was previously thought by planet scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions of years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen@@ us escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the League during his debut season at A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club on 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in any of the two last years the season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tracks with Montreal Canadi@@ en and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ v workers resume talks , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to remun@@ eration for the North Sea workers are suspended while all the armed parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start next year to address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ ctions in the North Sea by some 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its mega @-@ integration with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes ever held in the North Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rot@@ ates in the star @-@ pile up to different rates and in what relationship the rotation periods are with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ouses , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these stra@@ pping stars reach large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest generation of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
g@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars s@@ lows down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from base to base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ year @-@ old all @-@ star @-@ game participant of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him 27 million dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas ran@@ ger ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mile@@ stones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old shouldn &apos;t be included in the Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received funding for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends play the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was said to have sympath@@ ized with the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight @-@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an educated athlete would have won almost a medal .
the first official dop@@ ing incidents in Rio de Janeiro are known before the seventh race day .
the Chinese swimming pool Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news is about to die .
last Sunday , Ch@@ en demonstrated the hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de di@@ ure@@ tic which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but CA@@ S is responsible for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also at the night of Rio the news tran@@ se@@ pt over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance is supposed to be the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B test should already have a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both are taking the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , and Kenya &apos;s L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the athletes took care of the previous races in China for violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang hard .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ ets purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 metres of free @-@ style , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive for the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de , hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
black@@ mail program@@ mers currently target companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , in part repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators special@@ ise on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially ref@@ us@@ able ran@@ som will be considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently observing a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to send ads .
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software .
first of all , private users were the target , but the transition to company attacks took place terri@@ bly fast over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users own the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 per cent of affected German companies reported losses of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operations , in one case people were in danger of living .
several hospitals in Germany have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of perpetrators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure security researchers have examined the areas of use and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate some hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the previous malware kits were created by buying malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , looks and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log into one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 per cent of the company IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that sh@@ un@@ ting ran@@ som@@ ware can be rep@@ lic@@ ated using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful eradic@@ ation , the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the de@@ con conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat which was connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a blocked heater might well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and rear .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l for back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the 650 mm charge level is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment tested in the top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the city emergency brake assist ( works up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because when manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler responds to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation navigation , app integration and more .
two USB and HDMI ports are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting at 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline doesn &apos;t stick : down@@ fall to passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable if there are dangers that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
after their trip , a sick leave will only get money back if the cause of the disease is to be found without a doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have reported the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family on the second day of their baby ur@@ age was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective treatment plant which allegedly poll@@ uted sea water .
the family had the view that the trip was therefore fla@@ wed - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs were not successful in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er learned about it just before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
no im@@ pur@@ ities found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the atro@@ cities committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be vig@@ il@@ ant and resol@@ utely react to terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split@@ ting .
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength will also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals until the parliamentary elections in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium of four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ce must be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is ham@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , such as reducing the threat of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister has a better social care necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken against activ@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a general prohibition of full wear , it is problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you bor@@ row , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and ability to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway network
it takes a regular look at the stra@@ pping road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal action plan is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a good news for all drivers who drive in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ er road exit at 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right from the hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : traffic is getting up early , improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district of Mu@@ en@@ ster @-@ West represented .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
this is why the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 is shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic is guided only one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt more than a quarter of a century ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity to record the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated week@@ day traffic jam will last can &apos;t tell the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , with years to be reck@@ oned , because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
the state enterprise deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays for the extension of the legal proceedings because with disabilities it was to be expected .
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Journey : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most youngsters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ chen@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December youth with and without refugee and migration background between 14 and 20 years will have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical im@@ par@@ ting are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tourism &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star shed is Per@@ sei@@ den , which , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , is one of the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is already far ahead of the alarm bells no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ß , member of the board of the German Society for Sur@@ gery and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you see for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in- and sleep disorder .
it is precisely the sleep that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there may be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not in@@ frequently is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors op@@ press each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and start to smile about everyday problems and worries , and there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ disturbed , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out about their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any lower level of sleep medical in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , one should contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises We@@ eks .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with drop@@ outs , in case of sick day@@ time fatigue , sleeping alco@@ hol@@ s or if you do not find the cause of a mal@@ function distur@@ b@@ ance , it can be explained .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera stands at the ceiling of the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite many screws to mount for better sleep .
We@@ eks counts on : regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , do not sleep too long in bed , do not watch TV while sleeping , avoid watching alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the pointing off of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he first fet@@ ched gold at the short @-@ term world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has been protecting his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € , no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly the way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
police officers of the Düsseldorf police on Thursday managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage posts as gang members .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport detected a gang that was known to police officers from past anti @-@ theft attacks .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and have been working together in a community , work @-@ rigid and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four actions to the thi@@ eves who have travelled to Germany for the purpose of commit@@ ting criminal off@@ ences .
at the same time , they had more than 15,000 euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between a rem@@ nant of cob@@ ble@@ stone : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not work at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes through play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , it will be built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will , however , preferably be illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel had repeatedly spoken out for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ cars on the ground , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the ju@@ bil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking vor@@ m late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the worry of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for a majority of police protection from the left @-@ wing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between occup@@ iers and their neighbours , apparently does not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; district which , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , among them almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been swept under large police force in a real road strike , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive liners from all over the world over the past few years : residents of GDR times and former home squ@@ at@@ ters share their Kie@@ z with them .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on thrown discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been disc@@ arded with colour bags .
no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ enses will make use of property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is weigh@@ ty : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal background , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and remained .
this is why it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former building gaps which the old inhabitants are crow@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so good are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should I do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of any drawn @-@ out genes that are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who moves should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , compla@@ ining bad about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the Working Group suggests that the honorary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mi@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
this meant that some - less sc@@ orn rather than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
sought was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just a relaxing Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors .
there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers are soon to be found in the was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow @-@ up refugees who have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the district council to the municipality and the job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far , so you have to rely on private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community dwell@@ ings have to be re@@ conditioned , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rehabili@@ t@@ ated or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean labour .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it is even longer and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
however , there are also problems , says customer honestly , &quot; people who don &apos;t work at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do they have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve call it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the attacks had been brought to an end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials must look for activities in the region and in the region .
they always found in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly is not afraid of politics .
actually it is unfair to place them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the location .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the invent@@ ories are already at full capacity to integrate the existing ones in a reasonable manner .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
