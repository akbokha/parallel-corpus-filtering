<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer studied with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid of sports" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was once again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself run over the complex of the ALRV with his family, on a horse he did not even swell for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>

<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbury leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental problem.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical differences." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The question of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep in doubt small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively drive back regulations and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has advantaged opportunities to open up and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">For this reason, taxes for the rich would be increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both of them are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it must be invested in that," "" "say Trump and Clinton almost verbally." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could still be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and reboot coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to quit." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment programme, Clinton, on the other hand, intends to extend and demand renewables:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpicious trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both don't want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better then, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months seems likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, there is a trump that wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe him, that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, is paying more taxes and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at most one year old.</seg>

<seg id="14">She is the area manager of Condrobs, a supporter of social assistance services in Bavaria, and focuses on women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are Poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentral accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">There are other reasons for the escape of women: "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour morals, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>

<seg id="40">In Swabia alone, winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>

<seg id="2">Substitute veterinarians have called their union to approve new campaign measures in their disputes about a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes up his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his retaining relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly by his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Restoring the veto becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report written in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued resentment on the slug empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glamorous palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that have rejected and treated badly by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they hadn't even interfered with the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey poured the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin smokes Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest trust.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it is said that without stating reasons," "" "the dismissal of Ivanov was ordered by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called (in Russian) that he was later the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "about his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state in terms of bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for leaving his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was, for a long time, one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff recedes at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at once would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - met with skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated item - you could almost say - post-burdensome post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensland crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said:" "" "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the deck decks at their place and the last section of the deck are getting a dongation for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project the closure is future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or shore side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances that the team worked towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens say: investors should be obliged much more strongly in future." ""</seg>

<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, you have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas but as 20 percent of apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is sharpened.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">Only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing back apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the western city, deadlines are coming out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased again, the aim of the so-called mixing-mix is to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are not going to play outside but prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the United States, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the car and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracked by 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of watched people who exercise 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to take "30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" stumble on deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly, reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mica players who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, healthier and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtakingly on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast died on Thursday for the championship title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles tournaments during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple battle title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has over the past three years dominated their sport, 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other, after winning gold and silver in the single majority of women in the artificial turne during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during their long way to the top never to have planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip to the gym, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture deceives.</seg>
<seg id="27">Suspended beam and floor urns - in which Biles holds the title of the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and sat on top with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman softly embraced her as she expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old male capitol, which is called" "" "grandma" "" "by the Americans, had a margin." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her exercise, she threw Kusshands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of 19-year-olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfall and large flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the communities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the commune of Tangipahoa would have demanded tens of thousands of sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these rivers flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi frontier in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams sent people out of the flooding water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, increased overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another step-son, who lives nearby, would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flocked and poured in," "" "Hansford said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high state of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed up to Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flooding had spread rapidly, as there were heavy rainfalls, and that the authorities might consider evacuation directives.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer in the vicinity of Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground was largely suctioned by rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescuing of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons failure in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS affiliate WWL reported that a subsidiary in Tangipahoa attacked 200 houses flooded.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which now both were flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets which were rinsed by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up in order to accommodate the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the Municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags provided for the residents who hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and stores.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last big flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum from the city administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it rained on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his statements, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooding, but no reported on Friday until now.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympionship in the Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America jubelte.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they gave unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastic primarily in private gymnastic associations which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel - clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and their families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both of their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities the innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen des olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Assistance, announced last night in a message: "assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current occupation crisis and it will be foamed to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls forming plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the floorcovering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on account of "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption King, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside electing cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should take a document to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter only needs to call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes applying non-removable ink on a person's finger when submitting their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should keep more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this is not only for electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the current mayor of Lutfur was to be removed from the corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "" "in a cynical manner" "" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have conducted "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation in which one person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter of mail - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the leading of evidence to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, in particular women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there have been concerns that... governmental institutions have unknowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of" "" "politically correct" "" "hypersensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists work in post-electoral documents to stop "harvesting elections."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the constituencies (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters go alone in the voting cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric goes over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the elective court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "he also criticises the ineffective" "" "checkups" "" "of the election registration departments of the town councils." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and throws of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cut off his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before finishing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of removing the rinsing button of a train toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to flushing buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a kid I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud-water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test sample showed a luminance number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off, after their lumbar numbering amounted to more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the movie he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed mad brainstorming that ended with saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others with which it was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="6">A Kenyan function had indicated that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, submitted a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson red in the Olympic village.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to test its own investigations, announced an IAAF spokesman.</seg>

<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.</seg>

<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that in this type of sport the surface area was looped and systematically suppressed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is more stupid than it has so far: summer holidays, heat and land-election campaign - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaign fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang out posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up votes in the end, only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last resort day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again leave the election campaign just close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting will be how much Neuling AfD will cut off and what remains at the end of a coalition's day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his great posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the pegrowing of the AfD." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create this" "" "hastens the rise of the right-wing populists, which is probably going to cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make electoral campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents; Merkel's federal electorate is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, even Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign booths on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, according to coke, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country, you crumbling the groundwork that it must be very demanding to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly exists in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the council of the CDU-winner Kokert on his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing:" "" "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday celebration needs to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is on the game, Sellering has called up his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and make their election campaign largely online.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign," "" "it calls the national president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "otherwise, green campaigners go to search for native vocal chats among holidaymakers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am and ending at 8pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have done everything pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>

<seg id="8">There will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of cabin cruises.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the resort has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pass traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there have been some significant complaints," "" "says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many detours were looking and more familiar with their navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franchising.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality encouraged the vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made herself aware of the situation on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been spent.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest route was at 77 hours per hour in the speed 30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg are now open the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakthroughs allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer," i.e. produced for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "only slight decline" "" "at Autohaus Maier, but also admits that of course" "" "the learner is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds explicit words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road renovation has" "" "thrown back" "" "its operation" "" "two years ago." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "half of his staff have to be released." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half were dismissed, the policy would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27. now, they also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fact that other regular guests are now less frequently passing by because of complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his pedigree returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "the CDU-man admits." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still considers this to be reasonable and doesn't demand anything that does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>

<seg id="21">Refugees who are deliberately brought to the country need to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than until now - such that commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of these are still unpluggable and are open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>

<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony has already got off lightly anyway by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only 0.9 percent of vehicles will be available to 3.37 million vehicles after the first seven months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lone middle-aged men love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before making haste to comment on him under the pseudonym non-AlleOne's middle-aged men with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed rebirth of records is not caused by a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after ages 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and grazing wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something like this: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slowly embracing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle aged, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy it me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink so much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and were forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection as a rule by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like phonica to see record stores offering a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received impetus on the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar noise plate covers, from objects that wake up happy mood memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector, and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee stands out of a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A poll of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I leafed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-less, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I am entering.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexbepacked pop instead of experimental jazz is reconciled from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the psychological trauma is hard to determine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a window-shopping than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives away with a dearest sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While giving the impression that jeans pants pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of Soho could send for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research surrendered that the results of YouGov vote, they unaccounted for at least in stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with a stroll through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the startling look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who raises no clue middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to suppress 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tear was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to be rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed polishing, there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary flash for complying with speed limits.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis in the final on Thursday evening when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji turned out to be wonderful and gave the attacks of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving coaches. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau stayed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hultuous Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Semalua turned a Touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reappointment and there was still more than a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed by other weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while still learning GB.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sullians, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounds, the fijis hugged and the UK kicked off crushing into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside Teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was ever present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in a second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39th unsulled application, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more assistant than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve-stricken morning talking about it more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group was" "" "Bavarian" "" "as exemplary." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the association staff, 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are church louder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organization activities, budget planning, fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land acquisitions in the area of the new wells (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the high-tank (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and there are always new additions, because water life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over the course of 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has established himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe on nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, his part, praised water-wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water-keeper and he was a loyal scarlet.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>

<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because one filled the high-tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - flashpoint for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green power funding are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Transition at the existing plants for so-called own power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry also threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered under overcapacity and a significant price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate, as the world's largest producer country China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat eased.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The ThyssenKrupp finally did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the produced quantity went back to the second month after each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors," "" "says Erhard Hackler of Deutsche Seniorenliga." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">He who demands his lungs regularly, even in everyday life, doesn't get out of the chest as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Employment Community of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia are sinking back to long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are thus practicing not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior enchantor, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also provide insights into the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can direct themselves directly to the church or the churchwarden.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and another human being was killed, according to the authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the beach in Patong, which was popular among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast required several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombings bear the same handwriting," "" "said Army General Danai Kritmethavee, Friday morning to journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but it is probably the act of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, one assumes that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the past few days the authorities would have received intelligence evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they would not have been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police noted their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bomb attacks, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "after the bombs explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, the necessary trips to these provinces will not be discouraged." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is heading towards stability, an improvement of the economic situation and tourism." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody upheaval, reportedly considers itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the violent rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, some 20 people were killed in Bangkok on a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the easily overhauled swimmers from Ethiopia came so slowly that at times it was no longer visible in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently turned into a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24 year old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special charter from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fast the first nicknames made the turn.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as the "ruble of whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "following a" "" "well-being" "", "the English tabloid" "" "The Sun" "" "with" "" "Dad Bod" "" "made fun of him." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he first hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-metre-free style, played no part.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the Swimming-Team from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a pre-run over 100 metres of open-air.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was then frenetically fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high rate of calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the household by the district council Kulmbach found that undercover for these wastewater facilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the village of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from the world of Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to dig deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period will also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt thus justified the serious fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, for example, costs for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair costs, all three plants have fallen into a considerable extent, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that in the Azendorf wastewater system the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced as a result of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pumping station Welshahl had to recover from the ground almost 20 years old and during the Lopp pond wastewater treatment plant, the first clarification pond had to be discharged, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses came from the continued assistance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still under the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past when they were accused of promoting the app's blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed a filter to some users this week, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and abandoned cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely used across the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and yellow said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-resistant, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the scraping extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration campaign, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case before," said Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racist controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence service information, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a review committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Councilors Committees, Secret Service Committees and the military budget committee, reported great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Census, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence gathering information that was typically endorsed by high-ranking Centcom Commanders recorded regularly a positive image of U.S. efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," "" "a newspaper article cited the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "stated Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans summoned the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights and will be continued during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway through the Ministry of Defense's general inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the highest ranking democrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, as Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damages the moral of analysts and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at the Centcom analysts in terms of" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon chief inspector, who were admitted to the complaints of Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen des trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristle guard to the swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympics and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived that many people I had interviewed did not know that it is an Olympic athlete at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but rather an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the sparse trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling motions (turning, holding and Saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to the type, level of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold farther, faster, upward and upward, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to the top and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also the TV transmission also another high goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-directed aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal recently - Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia clashed with the government's violent resistance." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last decade, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable rate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor wear to stranglehold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness erupt after years of drinking piety under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians told them that they gathered so much to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of aeons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairer dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, representing about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and policy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which, according to analysts, seemingly deceived by the government and were then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it is obvious that this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal misunderstanding.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred for the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently communicated that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, was not meant seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow-workers who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump drew back with reference to the claim on Thursday and insists in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rattles Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's email, but later he explained "Naturally, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," "" "clarify" "" "according to what reaction happens." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump assumed an even more corrosive tone since its survey results declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent spokesmen of Trumpur, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it ambushes, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by attacking the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around and biased on each of his words.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he scorned the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="4">His menu on this day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>

<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil, while coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>

<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and brasseroles became a staple food, the casserole as a "wonderful way of recovering food leftovers," noted Brickman, as cooks were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a seldom serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures were tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>

<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa country house kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the million-heavy man of the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>

<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was used on food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haiders usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haiders get offspring only with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle embossed by slowness, however, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland hairs will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's arks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentagons measured them, when they left six animals in front of Svalbard and equipped them with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cadavers to torch from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland haiders who brought fishermen from Greenland or Svalbard from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed prior to the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres in length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland haie with the multiplication obviously has at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusalemes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows a lot faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," issued his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he was proud of the legend when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys's withdrawal only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time for the execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinds, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner put in the qualifying rounds an Olympic record, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn, Hinder was almost back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Behind when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinderer admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that's a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in cycle power.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23rd March (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a spoils of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny participates next in the sprint, which starts today and is going to go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record won gold in London 2012 was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had contested yesterday with the commissioners before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a char of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton technical manager in April in the midst of sexism and bullying vances as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when one looks at the first evening of the Velodrom competition, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs which has reached its peak at the perfect moment could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract and thereby abolish all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no other subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workstations in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa signed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting cheese of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the great aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions" which would have come into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL revenue from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties, the" "" "Ability Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the smelting" "" "did not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry against possible closure of Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts per year and Tomago consumes some 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the cliché story of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we forgot you?," with the honesty of a cartoon kite on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (aut fashionista were of the 832 pages of the ramdisk 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his coverstar is expected to be so addictive that in the last two years pictures of the magazine might still seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years more" "" "celebrities, who modeln" "" "as" "" "models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to celebrities, or reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is applicable to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success does not appeal to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her the Mistress of the Moment.</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling high again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the mischievous seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still slowly spinning.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exponentiates its day-to-day sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions of years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogenus escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus, which we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotates in the star-pile up to different rates and in what relationship the rotation periods are with the planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhouses, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these strapping stars reach large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest generation of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slow pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star-pile of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star-pile of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight-lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">An educated athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official doping incidents in Rio de Janeiro are known before the seventh race day.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming pool Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-obstacle-runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions this news is about to die.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last Sunday, Chen demonstrated the hydrochlorothiazide diuretic which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, just about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but CAS is responsible for sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>

<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B test should already have a positive effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: as perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, in part repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially refusable ransom will be considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were designed to send ads.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the transition to company attacks took place terribly fast over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users own the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of affected German companies reported losses of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operations, in one case people were in danger of living.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the areas of use and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate some hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, looks and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals employ spammers with the dissemination," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that shunting ransomware can be replicated using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful eradication, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price escalations," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could have completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the decon conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat which was connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heater might well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "it is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised and 1026 l for backrests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the 650 mm charge level is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine version: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering is likely to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment tested in the top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because when manoeuvring many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation navigation, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and HDMI ports are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel starting at 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is already far ahead of the alarm bells no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weß, member of the board of the German Society for Surgery and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you see for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an in- and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There may be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is the sleep disturbance expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is most common in depression," "" "said Weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors oppress each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and start to smile about everyday problems and worries, and there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, undisturbed, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out about their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lower level of sleep medical in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with dropouts, in case of sick daytime fatigue, sleeping alcohols or if you do not find the cause of a malfunction disturbance, it can be explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands at the ceiling of the sleeping-ends.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the pointing off of the DSV team at Olympus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he first fetched gold at the short-term world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting his ex-teammate against his ex-team-mates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 €and a jungle-king 150.000 €, no one should wonder about missing medals," "" "wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page on Friday night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming sport is bad, whereas doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">Police officers of the Düsseldorf police on Thursday managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and luggage posts as gang members.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civilian officials in the area of Dusseldorf Airport detected a gang that was known to police officers from past anti-theft attacks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July of this year and have been working together in a community, work-rigid and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four actions to the thieves who have travelled to Germany for the purpose of committing criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, they had more than 15,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a remnant of cobblestone: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes through playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it will be built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will, however, preferably be illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly spoken out for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team-cars on the ground, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers were commissioned by the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers marched under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking vorm late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share the worry of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for a majority of police protection from the left-wing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between occupiers and their neighbours, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers" "" "district which, in comparison with the rest of the city, has a low average income and high poverty risk." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been swept under large police force in a real road strike, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and elective liners from all over the world over the past few years: residents of GDR times and former home squatters share their Kiez with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on thrown discs or freshly painted facades that have been discarded with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year together with the words "Left-Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenses will make use of property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal background, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps which the old inhabitants are crowding.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so good are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of any drawn-out genes that are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who moves should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area, complaining bad about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the Working Group suggests that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmichsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less scorn rather than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just a relaxing Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon to be found in the wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow-up refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district council to the municipality and the job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, so you have to rely on private apartments, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community dwellings have to be reconditioned, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rehabilitated or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean labour.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it is even longer and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who don't work at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some naive call it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attacks had been brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always found in the background that soon a new thrust of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is not afraid of politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the location.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the inventories are already at full capacity to integrate the existing ones in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
