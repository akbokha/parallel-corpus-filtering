Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing action in the Middle East .
but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal raised by Obama about Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was part of the affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting was rejected by the election in Israel that was imminent at that time .
in an emergency call , Professor decided to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat trem@@ bling voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note hanging on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he killed and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency exit sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
a day after shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the University , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
in the spring he received a doc@@ torate in education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , attached to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer market three years ago .
later they played one or another gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clean up and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community took part in a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch vi@@ gi@@ l while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now claimed that Lamb was calling the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the 2014 Holiday Season , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increased from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and businesses are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an ar@@ mes@@ len@@ eck of it , with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ question@@ ably the biggest travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of constant conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the margins of the meeting of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the sp@@ li@@ ts in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at poll@@ s down , it has ( still ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one was able to win a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump holding assets and start letting their dollar flow in order to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps of arbit@@ rar@@ iness have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans viewed the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week stated that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first pres@@ et state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their jel@@ ly hats , Republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination wins , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is evidence that a variety of GO@@ P voters can view the campaign as a plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump almost beats anyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to lead to lead s@@ ling@@ ing , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can Can@@ did@@ ates , Tr@@ ump picks up the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the Immig@@ ration and fishing point in the public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ ally angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is most expensive .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential venues , however , one of the prices comes from the same price as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ known .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich , as an exception , is not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double tor@@ ped@@ o in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern towards a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e took a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won her opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received a good aid from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto at his 28 matches in the Champions League for the Bavarian tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled in 2011 .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their aggressive ende@@ a@@ vors , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks have often been initiated by Douglas Costa &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to put needle sti@@ cking .
on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was a discount .
for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports manager Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something different , it &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern @-@ fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with striking sticks against the Munich adher@@ ents .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore caused by more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of quit@@ ting smoking , explained Er@@ st@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness was affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter traces of late anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department for arch@@ eological ground conservation .
in the third construction section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , the archae@@ ologists were now found .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught in freight train
after a young woman is unhappy at the railway station , the Federal Police also asks the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the railway track and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
by capturing the train , she has suffered severe injuries from the Federal Police .
she was treated with medical care and brought to hospital by rescue forces .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no knowledge of the medi@@ ating cler@@ ks .
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Railway , Ziegel@@ bak@@ ehouse , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free Hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its function is much more traditional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström , responsible for the European Commission &apos;s presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position to the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP is set to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration procedures stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the USA and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be obj@@ ected against judgement .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , and there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work according to their own data on an International Investment Court .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which companies claim damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yer , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act proposed the proposals of the European Commission to be insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was mainly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described plans as a great advance .
the Commission took into account essential points in the reform , the Federal Economic Affairs Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it .
when discussions on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be held at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting fol@@ ks@@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has turned out to be a wonderful creative Irish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a series @-@ wide series : each of the 50 states should be followed in succession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks down positively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the New York @-@ based musician returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thinking about ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth album album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs desc@@ ended , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co@@ es .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core does St@@ ev@@ ens humble himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally tends to tend to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ de
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture has been eag@@ erly awaited since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ de and join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after its appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the Labour leader &apos;s decision prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several story @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesman said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also pil@@ ed up within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour should make changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch Box over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Fra@@ gran@@ de of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dispute with hooks and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle will represent the shadow of economic ministers if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy theater , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questioning . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased ab@@ rup@@ tly by data showing an increase in the UK wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and achieved estim@@ ation at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - back growth .
shares of Glen@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his assessment for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young , a ham@@ mer@@ ing with a sei@@ s@@ mic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros hard .
rather even more .
Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is currently in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 is spinning .
as Vik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name of &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the commercial break of the super@@ hero he generated three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company fl@@ ushed many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and in every doll that looks like it and over the counter , Bi@@ eber also cas@@ c@@ ates .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one is astonished at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others emphasize that Bi@@ eber is finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanon to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it goes both - in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is spinning in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now been made to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility models .
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Land Commit@@ ment Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ case
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A tra@@ der and supplier jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual investors strategy day .
there is a lot of stake in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets 12 months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mostly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which supplies around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt at equal print on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler however resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ in order to match selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging remedi@@ ation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious engagement with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp s@@ worn a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth about the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty much more exciting about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a bit in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a thu@@ g out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Kyr@@ gi@@ os at the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to concentrate entirely on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick was very quickly made up to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think for appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed out to protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a dispute in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ sized Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not set its hopes on a swift campaign of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stood in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire arrived to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders acqu@@ ires her against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some profits .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a great advantage with the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ ander with a double @-@ digit margin on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say nationwide that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ tr@@ ability are quoted as well .
as the Vice President tos@@ ses a potential for the presi@@ dency to the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is against S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , Demo@@ crat voters call questions about elec@@ tr@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters emerged unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Can@@ did@@ ates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be provided as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected overall .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as being honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however receive good scores with leadership .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty by the six candidates tested .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
the two candidates now account for half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down at the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio res@@ ide in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump beliefs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was fain@@ ted and claimed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and basically set the bro@@ therhood &apos;s good over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been inj@@ ected with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for religious attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also hold it accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College denied the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a raise of interest is coming , and the house will be bank@@ rupt , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little instruction for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in the way the economy and financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss might be exagger@@ ated because of interest rate increase .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be diver@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly up@@ war@@ dly in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob D@@ oll , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on the stock starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , there were only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whe@@ ther it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year on a raise of interest of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all development cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ öh@@ en very soon after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the firm income was also volatile as the market has anticipated a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds appear to change direction once the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the erection cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer co @-@ operation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ation of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
in the large and entire businesses , companies that are involved in the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will become worse as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in equi@@ ties also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure equity games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Committee Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative Member critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contemp@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something what the private sender does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said the BBC Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commissioned new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience than did it in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , fell under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the next time it started an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest possible result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to purchase purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers hit their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some merchant sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium saw that out of £ 5 expenditure a little more than £ 1 was spent online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of men bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the Bin Laden &apos;s family in Mec@@ ca - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia partly lays down the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family caused a san@@ ction , which also left 3@@ 94 .
the bodies of 29 dec@@ ors who were killed as a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ or of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited foreign travel .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e who pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner court yard where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the breakdown of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group due to not current security measures and because it was not co@@ operating with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same sum to permanently injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .

this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can skil@@ fully deal with a hammer or brush for painting walls , these days apparently belong to a minority .
for Br@@ its increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which focus on tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate with the employees .
she said it was necessary to present the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover , after the group ow@@ es the costs for closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the K@@ lagen@@ furt Regional Court , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 used funds from the accounts of the association , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial gri@@ ev@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was divided by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created .
the sports officials had only charged allowance compens@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the pas@@ siv@@ ity amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were in front of the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; one of the defend@@ ants said , in the B@@ read @-@ based Ac@@ tor of the Fis@@ cal Office .
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
in the case of financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance compens@@ ations was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one has paid off part of the allowance for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account .
for this reason , package and not detailed bookings also appeared , explained the former chairman of the proceedings .
the accounts and savings accounts shared the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judges asked why the dis@@ bur@@ sements were not disclosed in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial support , it is important that the freedom of debt has been important , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an investigation began in 2011 against the official investigation of office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the bank account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were set@@ backs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the defend@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this securities account expi@@ red on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he finally said he had believed that this was the best thing for the association .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed that the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims settlement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never got a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not show accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are no longer preserved after an audit in which everything was considered correct , they explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
all the arrangements had to be made in cash , so he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he said in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reductions that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will reduce further jobs during the split@@ ting up of the company .
the positions in the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this means that costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share stated 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the company , which has grown up with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split@@ ting up : this is how the computer and printer business will still be bund@@ led in a new company - separate from the future @-@ oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for company customers after its services were the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to the latest .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split@@ ting up and massive sub@@ missions to the shift in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently responded to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans overall envis@@ age the disman@@ tling of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS education mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would predominantly reject rejection : 54 per cent said , on the other hand , 35 percent were agreed .
61 percent are positive that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with Syrian President Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad rejected 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second day of the day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility up to 27 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto @-@ Association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : break @-@ out of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police attacked the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water laun@@ cher against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he told us by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and a water @-@ lamp was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pe@@ pper@@ mint .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sack@@ ed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
the world watches when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was still last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and the interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will last .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has landed on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of service , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ inous outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death prot@@ ectors at the Delta State University leaving ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He was shot at a man , and a man killed .
lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen brought him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as well as his li@@ ke@@ view on the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the Group restructuring the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to deliver a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Head Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the real@@ ignment , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three @-@ quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of the collective agreement with the pilot @-@ cleaning cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union with .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit hopes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as quickly as possible in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa is reloc@@ ating routes to the company &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external defender to tears and decided to exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very heavy and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the sus@@ pending of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws Account said : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK defence team has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg erup@@ tion when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland Team during the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children as it always seems to give an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead ren@@ ders a summary of the movie version of 2012 that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears the local environment through the monetary gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , Th@@ ought stri@@ ck@@ enden Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , gra@@ ceful essence , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times behind one child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a reverse victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown magnitude on test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th divor@@ ces from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he will hopefully turn out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude even if he did not bring such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost opportunity now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks appeared , and I did nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a hit man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my earlier te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before appearing as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns right away and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room , even if the messages are in harmony with what is said before .
Coll@@ y &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy by heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy reaches a l@@ ull in 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold UK in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to Labour or TU@@ C leaders who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ er recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain itself created agenda with pal@@ p@@ able concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually don &apos;t want to be sati@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
prime ministers and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes to see Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his release in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally do not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , throughout the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ ight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ inv@@ ali@@ ers who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums because Bla@@ ir had made the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time anymore for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I just press it - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ der Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ änder@@ ism can probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports at their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a Brut@@ al of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their supervis@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was supposed to receive funding from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports previously by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee will not be delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include an industry funding in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also attended the tobacco line of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a shortage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products on most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that it had previously been re@@ acted to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national competence .
BBC should give up East@@ ward , says former Chef of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ward and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent which would clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee what I think medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they will send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ward is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC altogether .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for ratings is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like East@@ ward should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ine programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfil their duties , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think we all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example at public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , clarify and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ band alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are emit@@ ted with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that ab@@ oun@@ ds electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when it turns ultras@@ on@@ ically to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which needs to be sent to the desired location in the brain on a optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around advertising for the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire - by a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is an invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors che@@ er fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly nerve @-@ burning to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you get , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ Year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly don &apos;t love Mar@@ mite or hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and press their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ ypass culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I spent for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people falling asleep when you kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who are in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded with still more lu@@ ke@@ able music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbors sleeping two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all mig@@ rate together all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is more fine than it seems .
a good stup@@ or is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never cut one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the blanket no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for example for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee stream , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if you put people in blocks of housing .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have completed my project correctly .
especially complicated it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ estimated who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ ders : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not you ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ners .
I show you how to build and build good things today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking up the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may switch off half way and this could result in a crash of updates .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Chess lovers Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago and has added another member to his ranks , so the membership increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by the president Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot muster the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are to be promoted as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation moves down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , Sen@@ iors and Rat@@ ings receive information on questions such as care insurance or health care services .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insur@@ ers is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre in particular in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

according to his own statement , 30 kilograms of muscle mass has been added in the past two years .

in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bone frac@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove past demonstrations .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim were checked with the help of a head@@ stock .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now , only a vag@@ ue day description is present .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and sign@@ al@@ ers to report on the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ t@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows of years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing their professional training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple mil@@ ler liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so we agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father , Frank Müller , grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new chief will be prepared from September 19 .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros is given to the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding programme of the District ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ HR &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter of 2000 patients come to the practice field , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too .
by the way , anyone visiting Müll@@ ers is still looking for familiar faces : takes care of the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ lows .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long period of time , she already felt a little sad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself in front of gardening work , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being raised on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a asylum claim is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , however , already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to make its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country will host about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted to Croatia , and Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it would allow people to propose specific routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the approximately 500 kilometres away Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previously predicted postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control possibilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive ways of border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good certificate to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side , around 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning with a local public appearance in Hor@@ gos : he stopped the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers recommend migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee hel@@ pers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges hack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of gaining access to un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exploited information , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ ema brought attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite often confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as the volunteers .
while a p@@ asser@@ by interfer@@ es spontaneously to the chal@@ k and the phrase &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffering , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action on itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me eventually comes the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is joint with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate publicly to the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still associated with tab@@ oos , such as Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open up .
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ ema sought an hon@@ our@@ able official , she immediately reported it and was there when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle their tasks and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
every two years , training courses for new employees are offered .
the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply gi@@ ants lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by about 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
despite the price increases , the lower prospect will be 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ board transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million US $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US dollars .
analysts asked six of Z@@ ack &apos;s expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex reported a decline in international priority shipments , which resulted in sales in its unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit reported higher income due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the interest rate .
lo@@ oming over them at the end of the adorned , two @-@ storey residence hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation primarily will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial market uns@@ ett@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a raise of interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm down the financial markets so that she could not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world arrived at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the high tide of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when the interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , at that time , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor developments elsewhere , but also discuss with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements linked to apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the onset of the market in 2008 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Rate of the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ longed @-@ for gym@@ n@@ astic building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the completed construction proposal was unanim@@ ous without any major discussions .
previously the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turned again to be the ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the building plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the a@@ version does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - although the municipal council usually drives more restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a recurring project , however : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymnas@@ tics building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meter high hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the unexpected plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who are not able to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au are offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entered the game , which agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
in passing over for the next two years , Fischer is said to be with his team if the supervisory board agrees to both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hip , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ acted rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ liga , should be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ rist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to Le@@ ch , which has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer works for more than 30 years as chief physician , has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure over the past decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season the ba@@ thers took a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
Jag@@ ü@@ ll with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use as the police shared .
after a shooting , a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old began to kill the young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a violent crime scene since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police shared on Wednesday .
as a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , who had the deed issued the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys among friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the police interro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the body in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigations are to be taken into account of the immediate circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the German housing market has long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable homes .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
in this way , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation facility .
many come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing construction policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit that will increase from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 housing units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , lam@@ inated Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals lived in large cities not@@ ori@@ ously in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended for a limited time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was rec@@ alled .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free passage : Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the crossing of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into effect on the same day , practically render decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the morning .
most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are barely any more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border quar@@ rel as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted convic@@ ted prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ones &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees sitting there .
practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the bor@@ eh@@ ole was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge on Sunday we were busy with ti@@ dy up when there were suddenly ten people with travel officials at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly hired railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first en@@ o@@ iled the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers on Sunday evening had moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was shut off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing generally is high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably organised a two @-@ leg course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further zig@@ z@@ ags to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has raised the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national socialism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guiding these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , to make decent states for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try quarters
Con@@ rad has filled all hands with the fle@@ eing of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Start @-@ up Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the last year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the national cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
in the morning there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , it should be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies it could not be that district providers have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , was more successful when placing them in place , based on his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom you can &apos;t say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the republic as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for quot@@ as has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the housing of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected are currently unable to accommodate these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city boss on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday massac@@ red the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
for now , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria also carries out controls on its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the approach of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter rest area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to de@@ fer the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade : finally , she has gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories will cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago it was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long been thinking about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la @-@ Produc@@ ers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most likely when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are looking for a hand@@ bag in a hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself extern@@ ally , journalists che@@ at or reveal knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig quarters with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which alongside Tr@@ ump is also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accidentally the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to high German : the en@@ coder , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz were at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker at retirement sees the American rather distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family ended a visit to the church organ , which generally sounded good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t want the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinema go@@ ers , also in the USA arous@@ ed interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the Today &apos;s Reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 from Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these mor@@ nings more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for checking !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and sm@@ ote slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quotes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute not managed to out@@ pace the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three two , you may accidentally have a clu@@ e on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a cor@@ rup@@ ter who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well @-@ suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who would choose Wood , if not she was , she was mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a boom as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a punch return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .

the Free voters are demanding the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn break , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get awards in the Bavarian Education System . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the national policy in the city of Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ let on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police gun@@ shot into a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the ru@@ pe@@ e district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , senior district cler@@ k , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , which are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the age of 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the law@@ makers have voted this week on specific cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den youth centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are still no specific offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4,000 square meter plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
planned is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
we wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly no contracts have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the plot , which is situated on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great street , already a few months ago and the building was demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor first presented public plans for the project .
some An@@ gli@@ ders are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure facilities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing went on to the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t answered any questions yet , &quot; he said before the council members and over 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the project has been in discussion for months , which is about ten to twelve million euros .
hef@@ ty reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he fears like some other project critics that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase strongly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus loads must come to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well 1 hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the planning plans were still variable .

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ taken the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / are claimed to be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who suffer from fat obesity with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
the results were also better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose levels , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also toler@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people who have undergone a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama , Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education for which Muslim countries can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented upon George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and found out that the US &apos;s violent reaction drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years that swallow highly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them start in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ infection products intentionally drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection agents with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection agents within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry sc@@ rub disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was put into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lou@@ dly l@@ apped her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand des@@ infection agents outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredients .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to han@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are rum@@ ors of disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , since they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch championship leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there &apos;s no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no more highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we must go on .
we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better .
to stand together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which indicated that he hur@@ ried a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new arri@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ Target Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .

Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle set for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent by the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later rev@@ oked - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn in Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added , &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I &apos;m not going back to Ty@@ s@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but he says that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it grows overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , the occupation of Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish employment market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken distur@@ bs the process

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and because there are often more applications available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ aster lot@@ tery will take place to decide who will be elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I complain to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .
man after wet police tracking hunt persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t T@@ up@@ a test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go up@@ lifted main and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I &apos;m doing with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L hag@@ gle over and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the training levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ tor , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has mistakenly put mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against rival due to claims on ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson stated that the arbit@@ rators allowed the storm players &quot; w@@ rest@@ ling &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett got a little war@@ y note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling as she struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny as it always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &quot; idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you would like to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses making and no points anything exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit according to drug delivery
a man , potentially threatening a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ di@@ mentary explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accident at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Karlsruhe : the driver &apos;s cab tear apart &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing plan was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used words for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg claimed that he had done it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the spirit of the Indi@@ ct@@ ment to have in@@ decent images of children on the 14th of June last year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a deposit in this case but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot via bridges and du@@ st@@ les .
there they are taken in reception by federal police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
at the Munich Main Station , more and more refugees arrived on Wednesday compared to the start of the week on Wednesday .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 p.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the past days by the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with arches of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour , is still to be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
in 2015 , it is mainly a movement for compact cars that are currently selling particularly well .
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Technology ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not expected to become much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Frankfurt . Opel launches a entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a fifth @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade it comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 b@@ hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is shown at the IA@@ A .
on the outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er played hand at the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ris@@ ked Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial authority Te@@ gel , who had spent months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that the man , who is now on the free foot after his lawyer &apos;s information , was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for the re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if , for legal reasons , only a few days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were decisive for the compensation , there was a compens@@ atory claim , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wor@@ rying of the legal protection of personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus , in April , they spoke a prisoner of harm to a prisoner because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ humane housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
over the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ro@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young people , 19 are to be dropped by 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially for affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ 000 social housing comes out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing each year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence obligation that asylum seekers are restricted to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the point of view is that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often communicated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ bags in different languages .
if the need for teachers to increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes in the countries .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state , asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up its position now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or toler@@ ation do not receive benefits after the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they begin studying .
the latter , in principle , do not get a banner , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ici@@ pi@@ ous persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g justified , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this span for 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get b@@ af@@ o@@ grams immediately .
in future , Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually submit to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Church right to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also belong to duties .
the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a subject of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point for a decade and a general equality law .
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and the authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what immig@@ rant organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns man@@ power and capacity , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers immediately at the registration of health cards .
provided services could later be rep@@ lic@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law provides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors make especially the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are ill @-@ informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs must be taken over , it demands .
however , many refugees would have been helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , among refugee camps there are much more in@@ treated disabilities , and in young people HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment is concerned .
with the partly other illnesses , German physicians come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the trav@@ ail is perhaps even allevi@@ ation by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some of them even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill following estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable were refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer , among other things , so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z explained that the symptoms would be chronic if the symptoms were chronic .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group into the fascination of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick kil@@ ow@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the family therefore lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lunch cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
ease and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated with dex@@ ter@@ ity and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little else and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes a stand : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the top priority is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at its ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 : 00 PM .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day , for the show at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements made by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities .
the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused firms provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain at the European Championship .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd &apos;s investigation lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a delicate period of time , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its champi@@ ons league season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to pass by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven away from the distant hope to lead the association to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , giving us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as proof of suicide among young men on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a pi@@ tiful life ) is announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental health friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it even though they often stop to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who are de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the celebration of the day completely recre@@ ated backdrop , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will be taking the chance to pass by PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Don@@ et@@ sk Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they are not only seeking qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , who could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was designated as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field ranks a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps @-@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was not at least scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shooting game , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short of the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season op@@ ener after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could keep low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized by a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bavaria in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion league winner , two times club world champion , twice world champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already before the European Championship before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit ended 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on Dec@@ om@@ izes Vari@@ ety in Film Produc@@ tions
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about - whoever will also be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove struck by her white col@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded in front of dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ age teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement scored nationwide and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still weaker , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , albums have still their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned champion
professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task in the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , it gets the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of the Houston branch for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go completely into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the whi@@ stle well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run bite .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the seventh time in the major league in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , the Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pitch for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers made a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he has not struck very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four knit@@ ting outs .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the limbs .
he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ down lashing , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden &quot; &quot; &quot;
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the inv@@ ari@@ ed people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sport halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily sign up there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , according to the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls thanks to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the deliber@@ ate reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective looking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , but nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call them specific figures and pointed out conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole had to cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be shut down with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants were reported on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets .
this movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ ying the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a heart loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a united pro . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no Di@@ et Fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nonetheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
anyone who eats the fruits thus supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first fo@@ il@@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the mountain@@ side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , the hair @-@ dryer partly blows with a storm force through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure region over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the mountain@@ side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the com@@ mon@@ ts with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and especially in the Ur@@ i region with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to st@@ ow away from the alpine hill@@ side .
this is where rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected , this after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn winds out the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with a strong , partly storm @-@ blown rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind re@@ fres@@ hes up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday by the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith over centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square will become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a sin@@ ner sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions , according to historians , should have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who expressed his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the relevant topics , this can be quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ path , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
the same applies to the Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and this is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , based on painting , has dealt with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formul@@ ates his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Christian order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re @-@ establish art in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the pictures , let them look and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he gr@@ asp@@ ed life with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected mysterious themes for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failure in politics and administration ass@@ ures dr@@ one , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hills de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be made in October , the First Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle that I don &apos;t care about anything , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chancellor &apos;s Office and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out has to face politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot@@ ary instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every day , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we football @-@ allies can , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; kidney s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called for the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : leader of SAP loses an eye in case of accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a down@@ fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , after midnight , he fell on a glass of water which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can pass something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you &apos;ve fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;t replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen excluding skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore arrives at night races in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ oten Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired about a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely sm@@ ashed .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high loading of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change his pedi@@ gree on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change to the goal of the door .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe League matches in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final cover for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , continues middle @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the transformation of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A fair of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , under@@ lines the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio .
a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to ensure that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h is lifted .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically feasible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly explained .
still the Germans are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe that 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least 15 percent could be seen on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good each Vi@@ erte would not leave the car under any circumstances .

the final decision will be released at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the world @-@ ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September , it is a good fortune that the designer changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into what is hardly yet to be overlooked by the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was taken : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
the makers have kar@@ ted 14 tons of material according to the cur@@ ator Thierry - Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ eless fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes dressed , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first show , he did not have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
in the past , it was about long sti@@ cking machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for , for example , blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ gran@@ ary P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace fashion plays a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past foundations , is a growing order potential .
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we are already doing half of all orders with us .
Mo@@ gran@@ e P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales had been cut off .
there is almost no private trade and wholesale business .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ ware is much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , export , up to date to Russia and the United States , is also weak@@ ening .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also seeks to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow tip .
at the same time , the machine stops small cu@@ cum@@ bers at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ dry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
as a result , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; is not a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already saying : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned with the reform of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a major role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal state business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to tackle the consumer a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force against pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , some 50 percent of catches may not be sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they keep the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can be caused especially in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written statement by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run out more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
