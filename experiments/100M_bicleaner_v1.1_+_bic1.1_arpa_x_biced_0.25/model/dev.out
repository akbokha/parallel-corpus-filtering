Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has worsen@@ ed through the deal raised by Obama on the Iranian nuclear program .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , argu@@ ing partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor decided to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat sha@@ ky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Apostle Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb made a disa@@ strous call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty member@@ ships 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions which Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb executed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb raised in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
in the spring he received his doc@@ torate in education .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer market three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb completed his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the top and j@@ oked together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb opened the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says there won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products tra@@ der says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the holiday season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is increasing from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an ar@@ mes@@ hing away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ question@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief demands once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , UK and France - on the margins of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the sp@@ li@@ ts in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey results that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at poll@@ s , it has ( still ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that during this period of 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one has ever won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h Super PAC@@ s and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollar flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the popularity of tr@@ umps has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ torate GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans stated that they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans does not see the m@@ umps of temp@@ er as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they impose their money hats , republi@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters seem to have a plau@@ sible look at the campaign .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump almost beats everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to lead @-@ driven lead , while anti @-@ slip support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting majority support .
he took 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration of the pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration is left in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , there have been around half the support of Republi@@ can voters on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , especially due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a pol@@ l of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago showed that three out of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ ally angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt &amp; Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ art Route - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study , therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is the most expensive .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bush in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the prices comes from the same price as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
tw@@ ent@@ less tor@@ ped@@ o in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; witch &apos;s cau@@ l@@ dron .
trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won the Champions League tournament in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller received a kind of aid from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto who made a f@@ lange of the world champion pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offen@@ sives ende@@ a@@ vors .
the attacks were often initiated by stak@@ es on the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle sti@@ pen@@ ds .
but on the door@@ keeper , Manuel Neu@@ er , there was a discount .
for instance , when he led a shot of ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only after the final training the World Cup hero gave the green light , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports president Matthias Sam@@ mer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola also decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller went another .
before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of war@@ med Bayern fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich parti@@ sans with striking strokes .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er Long @-@ term Study .
the good news : in the event of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of a long @-@ term study by an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
tooth loss causes decay and inflammation of the gum , accentu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear how much smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could , however , take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ st@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , Director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E stated : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health up to a high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has affected DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from late anti@@ quity
for the repeated time archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for arch@@ eological ground conservation .
in the third construction stage of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists were now finding the answer .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs , which belonged to the church .
young woman caught in freight train
after a young woman is unhappy at the railway station in the s@@ cour@@ ge @-@ bin liners , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ pm the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , she has suffered severe injuries from the Federal Police .
she was treated with medical care and brought to hospital by rescue workers .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman there are no knowledge of the des@@ titu@@ te function@@ aries .
the incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard audi@@ ble percep@@ tions .
In@@ quiry comes from residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ werke weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to raise the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds significantly to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in charge of the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish Commission intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is expected to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the USA and from third countries .
for the first time , there will also be a second instance .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be raised against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no objection against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required mainly by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which will lead companies to engage in tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act outlined the proposals of the European Commission to be insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ König ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described plans as a great advance .
the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform that the Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economies of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
it remains unclear when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting fol@@ k@@ singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gri@@ pped by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always records on the map , describing his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has been a wonderful creative dec@@ eiver .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; intelli@@ gently composed songs that harmon@@ i@@ ously closely resemble American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ or is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a series : each of the 50 states should be followed in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared and had a positive outlook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ber@@ antly of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the most influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
since the smaller clubs have grown up , the stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark@@ ly held Hamburger L@@ earn more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ ps himself , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces has been anticipated with suspen@@ se since his election
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces and join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to present the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain on Tuesday prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesman said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t , says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; st@@ acks , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour MEPs put forward changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised another set of policies , says he has given &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the quar@@ rel with hooks and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will be represented by the shadow of economic ministers , if he doesn &apos;t take part , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also expressed the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the House spokesman , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove policy in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ l @-@ theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frame . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply according to data showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and most established estim@@ ation at the time of interest increase .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over supply of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that revenue in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - is reporting growth .
shares of Glen@@ core increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by a share sale as part of his strategy of reduction of debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the capital : auf Bi@@ eber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the age of 21 , a ham@@ mer@@ ing with a sei@@ s@@ mic p@@ inch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros hard .
rather even more .
Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is currently in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 goes through .
like Vik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ ina sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bi@@ eber construction : here you are living I@@ dol , whose poster hangs in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs the day as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obligation to pay ?
who che@@ ers it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
he has taken care of that anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the supermarket , he claimed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company fl@@ ushed many , many dollars to the eber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
if J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others emphasize that Bi@@ eber was ultimately ranked # 1 in the USA and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanon to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it goes both - in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg @-@ based snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese man has since been registered by the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y just how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; metal cash starts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sustainability campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - collapse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealer and supplier jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual investment strategy day .
there is a lot going on since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern countries .
analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , however , believe that Al@@ di will take up some five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all available actors , but mostly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted enquiry from Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ GA@@ S &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler is resist@@ ing and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to make selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops through faster @-@ growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging remedi@@ ation programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger one of the talented duo , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to get divor@@ ced twice by the arbit@@ er , with Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp s@@ worn out a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing that I am pretty much upset about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a thu@@ g of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Kyr@@ gy@@ z in the important preliminary ruling which starts on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think Nick was very quick to get up with what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and controlled the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence hi@@ jack@@ ed for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ aming insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the days ahead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc on a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ sized Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency in two southern regions announced on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having stopped a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the inj@@ uring of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire arrived to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ on@@ ised for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions determine which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some wins .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will only return with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton is still ahead of the senior voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders took a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters across the country say that they would support Clinton when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and di@@ lat@@ ability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the pres@@ elected voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half of Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage over S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that considers it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates generate good results in some important features of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts best with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be questioned during the term of office as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion about this happened in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email @-@ controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as being honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent consider them honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump are given good marks on the tour .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to a nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son finds himself closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times inquiry
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support is eliminated in the new survey , and others lose dramatic support .
the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down at the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio res@@ ide in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - he lands at 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the pump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to a car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood were bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an execution ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , condemned the police .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was fain@@ ted and allegedly warned an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the National Pres@@ idents of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide things and put the benefit of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said forem@@ an Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly inflic@@ ted injuries on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third tier for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for religious attacks and the formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest rates , and the Hou@@ se will be bank@@ ers , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in the way the economy and the financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end , market participants could find that the whole fuss could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that income yield gains from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to raise interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 had only twice nominal GDP at 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made an interest increase of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading will only increase 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions sh@@ outs very soon after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest maintained by the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the firm income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is rather similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are quicker than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds appear to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the erection cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
highly interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to anticipate higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and larger segment , companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will become worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial rate increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the tax increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in equi@@ ties also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure stock sp@@ ins , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher income , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative Member critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said they just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins tac@@ kled the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that he does something what the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director dismissed the alle@@ gations , argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 was far off its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and ordering new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it must be harder to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on Culture , Media and Sport came under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins joined The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it started an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ outs for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed down spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix to the Guardian .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers were starting to make purchases with their mobile phone purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth decreases .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers looked around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed off .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer fights for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 expenditure was spent on a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of men bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia partially bl@@ ames the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ p .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to clo@@ ak their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then collap@@ sed onto the worshi@@ ppers .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe which also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central mo@@ or of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane under@@ mined .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual meeting in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was out@@ law@@ ed abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e who pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because it had not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the fall of the crane arrived amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same sum to permanent wounded .
other injured receive half of this amount .

because Br@@ its increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate with the employees .
she said it was necessary to tackle the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this more into balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has owned exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob will be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of mis@@ use .
he has been acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that in 2006 and 2011 , the accused used mon@@ ies of association accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
this fact was divided by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created .
the sports officials only calculated expense allowance and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt , the liabilities were around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we faced the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants said , in the bread@@ service of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial center . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance is safe at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the compens@@ atory damages had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore one has paid off part of the allowance for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account .
this is why the former Chairman of the Ob@@ server explained the processes , too .
the accounts and savings accounts out@@ dated the two defend@@ ants , said the second accused .
the judge asked why the dis@@ bur@@ sements were not disclosed in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial regulation , it is important that the freedom of debt has been important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , a substantial amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros had been transferred to the bank account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account expi@@ red on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dents did not know any answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim res@@ titu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge and the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not provide accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was considered correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the second accused .
all de@@ port@@ ations were done in cash , so he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September by questioning witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard cuts further 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions that have been running for three years , the computer chip will build further jobs in split@@ ting up the company .
the positions at the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
this means that costs amoun@@ ting to € 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs for the past three years has not yet been concluded .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP still had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share reported 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto company , which has grown up with printers , is currently sp@@ li@@ cking on : this is how the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new society , apart from the future @-@ oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate clients according to its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest manufacturer of PC manufacturers came to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP rep@@ lies with a split@@ ting up and massive sub@@ missions on the shift in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded very late that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do business immediately on @-@ line .

the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , was predominantly rejected by opposition : 54 per cent said , however , 35 percent were willing to agree .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad with@@ stands 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent would be responsible .

Budapest : XI . , Sem@@ i @-@ finished detached house in quiet surroundings
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water ej@@ ector against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the violence break at the border control point .
he told phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the polic@@ emen there was a police line and a water @-@ light was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set pe@@ pper@@ mint .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now retired a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees s@@ sack@@ ed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at present stand from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est applied to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior associate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
death prot@@ ector at Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He shot at a man , and killed a man .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police looked at the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , which Lamb apparently believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb traveled to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University as well as his life lau on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm

all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone .
150 of the 1,000 senior executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and upgrading the low @-@ cost row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to contribute to a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no management board in the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the executive team headed by chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Mr. Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three @-@ quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the pilot adjustment cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ struck strike on this Thursday .
this is what the union divided .
the topic of the talks is to be the reti@@ ring regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit hopes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa focuses on the company &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven during the Champions League defeat of Manchester .
while this brought the left foreign defender to tears and will shut him out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very heavy and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the locker room .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frame then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet at Sha@@ ws Account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
the UK champion has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched it &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to use his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children as it always seems to give an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story@@ line of the book , instead ren@@ ders a summary of the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that were not suspici@@ ously enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears about how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the monetary gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , Th@@ ought stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , fi@@ ery creature that speaks in the name of the trees .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row after each other .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack .
this related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players their own best selection .
long ago , it would have been prolonged the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully he will get further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude even if he did not bring such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th had seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first made Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket Player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which really hit us .
he must have at least the same chances as before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four Qui@@ cks appeared , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a hit man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a Devil &apos;s cra@@ p from cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred runs straigh@@ ta@@ way and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the rac@@ quet and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s an Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful dedication to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room even if the messages are in harmony with what has been said before .
Coll@@ y &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .

the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy becomes a l@@ ull before 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ declared ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at law recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always full of guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with pal@@ p@@ able concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not even like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain has a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scottish withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies are .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally refrain from helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , especially in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the z @-@ euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
in addition , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum vor@@ tex , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need to waste time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , an error then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I always express it - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff trend and the wil@@ der cli@@ mates of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Little Engli@@ sh@@ woman can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary called &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ legitimate to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their clause convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a Brut@@ al of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks surely this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite burden economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if it can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to demonstrate their opinions on the damage caused by different ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer to receive , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports before tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee will not be delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the board also attended the meeting at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of the damages of most products on most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the asser@@ tions of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were considered a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that it was previously re@@ acted to the claims made by BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National healthcare system two billion pounds per year .
by stating current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should abandon East@@ ward , says former leader of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ward and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent which would clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medi@@ um- or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach the best possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could also be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ward is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that BBC &apos;s fault in hunting for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like East@@ ward should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ine programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justi@@ fying 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think , we all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for $ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also declared ahead of the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ th Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only a few of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have to be heard for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane @-@ channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms displayed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which gives electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
flat@@ worms usually do not react ultras@@ on@@ ically , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ day , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly don &apos;t love to love Mar@@ mite or hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find the people who you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and adjust their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert is receiving a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away to get back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of it : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat result in people falling asleep when you kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling foods is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the true sense of the word .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they had something to make drum &amp; bass qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more lu@@ ci@@ d music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all mig@@ rate together ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has lost his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never swallow one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how to build a cheap and good building today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will rush to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner thinks to know how quickly favourable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs very little space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily re@@ mod@@ elled according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have completed my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Pit@@ ch Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not intensi@@ fy the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that hardly could afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees but also the mother or the poor @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show how one can still build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then to install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message telling that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch off half way and this could result in a break @-@ down of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one thing in the fight for the World Cup title against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the start of the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup second stressed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the 12 season races so far and also won the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the German national service company 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation &apos;s clo@@ ak and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square .
in addition to consultations one can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , Sen@@ iors and Rat@@ ings receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance .
for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many services of the insur@@ ers are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center particularly in the demographic shift .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
furthermore , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also focuss@@ ed on the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Bureau is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because flood lights have a special appeal .
in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in 2010 attracted 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the region@@ alist 1 FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 @-@ year @-@ old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; as it was called in the outside .
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna during and after the Second World War at Friedrich Leh@@ mann .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design .
in the 1980 &apos;s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the renov@@ ations of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

according to his own statement , he wants to add 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not think intellectu@@ ally .

the accus@@ ations are confirmed by the city of Bremen , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual occur@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and struck the face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car right up to their apartment and drove past there demonstr@@ atively .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the m@@ allets and another male .
with the help of a head@@ stock , one re@@ counted on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far there is only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetrators .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ ers to sign up under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller to take over practice Fel@@ t@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also , Sam@@ t@@ clan mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ t@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stopping is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the coming months .
Müller will open the practice again on 12 October after a conversion phase , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the rock stand was introduced years ago by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so we agreed , the garbage cans bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Medical Officer in Di@@ ep@@ holz and was involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen in 2009 .
from 19 September the new boss will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon works as a doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a more speaking room .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros is given by the land@@ lords as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ clan mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter about 2000 patients come to the practice field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy stays in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stopp@@ ausen .
if no follow @-@ up would have been found , it would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s surgery , by the way , still look forward to familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power take over from the rocks .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stan@@ ze , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the long time , she already felt a little sorrow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself from gardening , but now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright in parallel .
as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum is also entitled to do so &quot; of course . &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and also to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ r Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , however , already severely checked as an outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to ban its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ r Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
she was able to pick up the Croatian police in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country will have some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were diver@@ ted from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media in accord on Wednesday .
however , the Belgrade government denied that it would allow people to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do it , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the approximately 500 kilometer distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made concessions , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previously predicted postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary can now come to a further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive ways of border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since then consistently issued a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side , there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm him on Wednesday morning with a local voucher in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers recommend Mig@@ rants to - Haz@@ ardous - Altern@@ atives Rou@@ tes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the border region even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard of a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which is accused of having gained insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ Publications and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the collected information , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets .
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 more accused in the event continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are to act both in the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a bu@@ stling activity around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , sometimes comfortably stro@@ lling .
they control the two stations of the car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
to keep the city run@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with splendid autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four large panels each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe pointed out to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ers spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and add the phrase &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; go with the camper through the US , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ische Fabrik Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is joint with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ association carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still cl@@ ung to tab@@ oos , such as Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement has helped to open up people in recent years .
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companions belong to the volunteers of the first hour .
faced with a personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe searches for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported it and was there when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all are well trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle their task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another perspective , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
every two years , training for new employees is offered .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .

at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share accounted for more than 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than with the previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
despite the price increases , the lower prospect will be 4.@@ 9 per cent on average and effective January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in the online retail sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company will yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts asked by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked by Z@@ ack expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority mail shipment , which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the bo@@ d@@ land transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded by 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to take the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ storey residence hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress to keep US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could cause the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes itself unsure of itself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the blow by promising that a further boost is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that it would be necessary more economic progress to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world arrived at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when the interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ rest@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor developments elsewhere , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the onset of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a raise of interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I do not believe that it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : tiny Leben@@ shilfe für Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees come to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home on D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
here she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole of other classes is at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to find a sho@@ cking way to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary amend@@ ment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried granted the construction request for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar installations .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited rever@@ ber@@ ation building at Bern@@ ina &apos;s sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously blocked without any major discussions .
previously the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ral first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan with regard to the ti@@ lt did not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the municipal council usually de@@ parts more restric@@ tively with regard to liber@@ ating jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for gymnas@@ tics , however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymnas@@ tics building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and amateur sports sponsor@@ ships .
in the next step , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meter high hall will be presented to the Advisory Board for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the unexpected plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which was confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 staff at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years Fischer will be with his team if the supervisory board agrees to agree to both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hip , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has counter@@ ed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ ap@@ schaft , will be used as an asylum seek@@ er for asylum in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ rist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ relo@@ cation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as head physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened with closure over the past few decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the mobile b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC today .
although the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no reason to be arrogan@@ t .
in the past season the ba@@ thers took a painful defeat in the Bh@@ c and got something good there .
Jag@@ stu@@ eck with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use as the police shared .
after a shooting , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
at first it was unclear how exactly it could happen to the accident .
the police have been investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 year old killed the young people and threw their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a victim of violence since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be susp@@ icious , who , in fact , admitted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after they did not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators initially met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ on@@ ator admitted to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to the load .
the further investigations are to be taken into account of the immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment vac@@ ancy
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable homes .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Building Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units in Germany this year .
in this way , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial lodging .
many people come across the apartment market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is launching an apartment deficit that will increase from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 housing units are missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study .
many professionals lived in large cities not@@ ched in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ ull on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended for a limited time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , according to the Alliance , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was claimed on Monday evening , with a total of 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free passage : Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
there is practically no going through to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing that it will pass through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day Hungary closed its border for refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the eastern border of Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not encounter a border fence .
but the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , however , there are barely any more refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws are classified as a crime to overcome and damage the border area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted prison sentences were sentenced to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area has been converted .
no one wanted to express himself to the aim of this reconstruction .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor passed &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge on Sunday we were busy with the clean@@ up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly hired railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , because of the refugee stream , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first neglected the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers went to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening , after the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was shut down at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest@@ verband ( Brü@@ cken@@ fest@@ verband ) with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably organized a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has moved highly official and publicly the position of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and approaching winter , to make decent conditions for people looking for shelter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try quarters
Konrad , with refugee staff@@ ing , has his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up neighbour@@ hoods for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ rad has already managed to get a grip on the chaos in the premi@@ er centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , without a great fuss , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 neighbour@@ hoods each year .
in order to meet the number , a total of 35@@ ,000 apartments must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15.000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial tri@@ bun@@ als .
these would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ene as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that lod@@ gers have to maintain a certain amount of the towel rail or size of the overhead obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , establishes that he is more successful in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for quot@@ as has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centre for accommod@@ ating refugees is planning the city of Linz .
Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) , is not required to do so at the moment .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the distribution of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to contribute .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders won &apos;t be shut down &quot;
in a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has cor@@ ded the further approach in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be termin@@ ated .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the appropriate border controls .
there will be no special moves with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the investig@@ ators , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ ing once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing checks on its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the approach of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later on which to acquire .
from the very beginning S &amp; D plans to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ hausen promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; D in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is pa@@ yed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit didn &apos;t really want to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to de@@ fer this project in the pi@@ geon market ar@@ cade : after all , she gained a further increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which it sells , among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a place where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ yce from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are wearing a hand@@ bag at the sight of a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag inv@@ ali@@ dates every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ springs .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists che@@ at or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is whi@@ stling vigor@@ ously for the election campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ eats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , including Tr@@ ump and the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a little &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked say@@ ings of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grandfather was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
do you think Tr@@ ump comes sometimes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally sounded good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ vag@@ ery at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ man Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 &quot; inhabitants &quot; village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country the Alpine Club is responsible for the awar@@ ding of the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
according to Can@@ ber@@ ra , Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in Today &apos;s ratings .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these Mor@@ ning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line by Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ ated father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe achieved an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ pass the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki perhaps have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor &apos;s .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three , you may accidentally have a clu@@ e about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be good as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood would be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally hired , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood would choose , if not she was , she was mysterious .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday doing 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding off his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his cro@@ pping catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was recovered in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees .
leader of the party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn break in Gros@@ wall@@ stadt from a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get awards in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free @-@ Ele@@ ct State Assembly meets in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune until Friday .
actually quite different main topics were fores@@ een .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &quot; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject will over@@ lay the subject of asylum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policy in Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing favourite is on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Education Minister Ludwig Spa ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ Level plus &quot; on 47 Gym@@ na@@ sien , in which an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ al secondary school from three to four years is tested .
but this is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index last recorded some 1 percent in the plus .
many stock markets account for the fact that the markets will be replaced by the interest rate decision in the US and also for the great decline of the stock exchange on this Friday .
the discussion about the charges from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .

the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , investors presented too little attention to the German chip manufacturer .
in doing so , investments in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off .
car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after polic@@ eman shot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern part of Nepal after the police fired up rubber bul@@ ls into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ ls .
twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ el@@ ites say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western part of Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week for specific cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meters of land in close proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor demand is not yet clear .
no agreements have been concluded so far .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that was situated on the Ring@@ straße / corner of Große Straße already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time , the investor publicly presented plans for the project .
some An@@ gli@@ ders are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months passed , closed doors were negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ de Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on to the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we haven &apos;t answered any questions yet , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the project has been in discussion for months , which is about ten to twelve million euros .
hef@@ ty reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who had come to the session shou@@ ted the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea owner and member of the board in the interests of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic should increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads to be reck@@ oned with , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well 1 hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the planning plans were still variable .

Google launches double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ run by the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railroad and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / , claimed to be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is being confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained at those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at 29 .
among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the diabetes illness completely dissolved and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about 2 percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best maintained under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared with the gastro@@ ec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obesity was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 with his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention at the Bell@@ et@@ r@@ istik : a young woman , un@@ loved and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school hours , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama tou@@ red Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education for which Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and found out that the US &apos;s violent reaction resulted in a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of exposure to disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 , who swallow a strong alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues from hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centers increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more often to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children do not intend to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in social media .
videos on YouTube show how to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection products with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave si@@ p around whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was taken into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lou@@ dly listened to her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and to store te@@ at disinf@@ ect@@ ants out of the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health officials suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in New York City planned to poison its &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to han@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the secret plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic music , there &apos;s no title rival@@ ry with the angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no more highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers aren &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I &apos;m going to turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen was followed , which now stands promin@@ ently at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly this way - but we must go on .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better .
coming together is so important .

heard on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts carried 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later rev@@ oked - the third Coll@@ um Red Card , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity questioning , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ro@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts Player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; the stor@@ mer said , &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ s@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management

Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen has had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see seventh consecutive league victory , giving them a lead of five points from Celtic at the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland will remain unchanged , while in the UK it will rise overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , the occupation in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland declined to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January via his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who will be elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have been better able to form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts series I did .
I don &apos;t want to go into detail here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry van Tre@@ z would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ asing persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a domestic peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Sergei Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
champi@@ ons football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threaten to finish the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria had tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ er test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go up@@ lifted main and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should be no more trainer .
I must think about what I &apos;m doing with my license .
before that , Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call if I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a fraud .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should that make me think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and does it perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now reflect upon it .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said he could &quot; throw off his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was put on the horse deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied slu@@ dge to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for claims on ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson declared that the refer@@ ee allowed the Storm players &quot; w@@ rest@@ ling &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett gave a scarcely concealed note to the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the qu@@ ack@@ er@@ ism of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team vo@@ iced him confi@@ dently , as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build up stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points anything exciting ?
for me , it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free this weekend , because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on next Tuesday morning .
serving Dru@@ gs with $ 200,000 Guaran@@ te@@ ed on Dru@@ gs
a man who may face a lifetime punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tear apart
in case of a collision with three lor@@ ries on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing break@@ er tore apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone for an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child mol@@ estation .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , log@@ cked into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ erts her mother .
the police took care of this and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used words for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg claimed then to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment of inc@@ iting in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January this year , viol@@ ating the conditions and not appearing before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other cases pending .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders prior to the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up in the German @-@ Austrian border , away from the major control points .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn river Inn in the Pass@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn district since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and traffic guns .
there they are taken in reception by federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
according to Federal Police figures , there were again significantly more refugees arriving at Munich Main Station on Wednesday .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure region on Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .

the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly on the move to the compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel &apos;s entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra , Mé@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e will only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
in the trade it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new in the segment .
with the new model , the Nissan fans want to find their position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts perfectly to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely re@@ done is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger laid hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was upgraded , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .

the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial authority Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to narrow spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with some five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 in a single cell . the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that the man , who is now again on the free foot after his lawyer &apos;s information , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest due to the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the verdict of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity inf@@ ring@@ ed .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of prison days were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was granted , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wor@@ rying of the legal protection of the personality would be feared &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kammer@@ gericht will now have to clear the amount of money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they said a prisoner of harm only in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had reached an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruhe &apos;s case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been exposed to the head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ro@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the shortage of young professionals , 19 are to be dropped by 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ al Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , particularly with affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units come out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is much too little from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80@@ ,000 social housing per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest a total of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , says Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to see if they are working in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ rations@@ evolution@@ ist Dietrich Landes@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to the recognition of work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence obligation that uses asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has prevailed that refugees should be allowed to gain access to the labour market faster .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often facilit@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the building of networks is , according to the view of thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for teachers to increase dramatically due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities , for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal asylum seek@@ er or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or ac@@ qui@@ escence do not receive any benefits after the asylum seekers performance law when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ o@@ g as they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ o@@ g@@ gling persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ o@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span shor@@ tens to 15 months .
but also this gap must be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get b@@ af@@ o@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively post the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation that is professional in taking care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also belong to duties .
the representatives of Islam must agree on clear partners and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately got their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole of society .
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for almost a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and for which international agreements like the anti @-@ racism prevention Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the good of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously anticipated refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right at the time of registration .
provided services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers to be created .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more ill @-@ informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , there are much more in@@ treated disabilities in the refugee camps , and the young people are concerned with HIV @-@ raising .
with the partly other illnesses , German physicians come from their training , but they realize that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the inf@@ eri@@ ority is concerned , the refugees may possibly even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some of them even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable were refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee woman arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z explained that the symptoms would be chronic if the symptoms were chronic .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege is inviting you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the aim is to attract each age group into the fascination of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a tile and was@@ p to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal manager and junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management of man@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for fan@@ atics is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cocktail cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
ease and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst intrigu@@ ed with t@@ act and agi@@ lity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics than little else and fascin@@ ates with her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ies &apos;s mother Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ understand@@ ings in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst is also taking a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well with our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stro@@ king unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly referred to , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper@@ most commandment is : good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at its ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 : 00 PM .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 to 18 o &apos;clock .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall rapidly spread across the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements made by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman for the Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the parliament members concerned that immunity is ending in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the intervention of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his history , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain in the European Championship .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had severely termin@@ ated the last season after a separate ank@@ le breach and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of po@@ aching since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the injury days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last for the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a delicate period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its champi@@ ons league season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to get a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to move by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , with the Richter scale measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger thinks that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven from the distant hope to lead the club to its first Europe apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as proof of suicide rates among young men on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the aim to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominant .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it even though they often stop to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My role in listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the fully re@@ designed backdrop for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know the difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria arrives to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ win Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PS@@ G helps to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond cav@@ ani kept course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ parking Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria took less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player who made the French champion the way , but after that , they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ ik@@ k Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the club , with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won even though I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team , who was able to hold a 2 : 2 oun@@ cement in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division on the weekend , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps Ligh@@ thouse in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave itself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which at no less than five experiments alone was scra@@ pped in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shooting game , which was given by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . by doing so , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League match was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented from changing to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion league winner , twice club world champion , twice world champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he was already before the European Championships before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was also the name of the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ y@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Munich .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is currently working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , switched the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on Re@@ duc@@ es Vari@@ ety in Film Produc@@ tions
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke down when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . al@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers &apos; colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a groove that is struck by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People voted for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film directing . Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned over 5,000 copies and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still weaker , &quot; he said .
like books and black lives , albums have still their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned champion
professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the last task was to climb a 75 foot @-@ long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task in the time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best bas@@ eball teams , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held up his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good during ( beating training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back hitting at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks achieved a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy handed over the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who pulled the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27 times in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Wall made an R@@ BI Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and reached the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
right @-@ handed , however , made S@@ ano out of three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit proved to be the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list prior to the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers played in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he has not struck very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s reli@@ ever right @-@ handed .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the limbs .
he is being examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder injury , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be killed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 upcoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily sign up there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls thanks to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options should not happen without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , and nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could hold a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call them specific figures and pointed out conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge force exer@@ tion . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be secured with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from dig@@ ging over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had a@@ verages the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , tens of thousands more migrants came to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this is what researchers conclude from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets .
this mer@@ ging movement is only small , but still too big for a thoroughly fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the technical sheet &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole it must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missed several weeks in Munich
the 1860 München must ren@@ ounce absol@@ ut@@ onic actor Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association was informed by an investigation of an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a united pro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive one .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove its ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his bra@@ ins shake , Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie will be able to return to the team training again next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to join the running training already on Thursday .
in the game at Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in a violent clas@@ h on his head .
contrary to his first fears he remained without a serious prof@@ ess@@ orship .

because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits thus supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some let@@ tu@@ ce salads like ch@@ ic@@ ee and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US package service U@@ PS again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 help for the Christmas business in the United States .
the company has already begun recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
most of all drivers are looked for .
last year U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 people .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the package services harsh criticism .
first fo@@ il@@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows with a storm force through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the north side of the Alp@@ enn@@ ines , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer ensures summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the alpine hill .
here rain sets in , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps , this after large ra@@ inf@@ all have fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer leaves the air , as a result a cold front rolled off with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind re@@ fres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days gra@@ ze in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park was chri@@ sten@@ ed in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square will become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a sin@@ ful sin@@ ner .
according to historians , his negative impressions might have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs had formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and this is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into today , into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Gl@@ orious Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was already education with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to be able to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in a so@@ aring period : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the pictures , let them work on themselves , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
I am not careful to grasp the Bible completely , but selected the mystery themes that are important to him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the picture , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
construction work for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching .
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circular course : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X course it was finished again .
failures in politics and administration ensured penetration , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
thus hill be@@ v@@ elled , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be made in October , the First Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate with the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the decisive turn@@ out has to face politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ id@@ ney at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot@@ ary instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvi@@ ousness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every way , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we football @-@ allies can , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so immen@@ sely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro 2016 qualification match against Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach referred to the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their own locations was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will jointly provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : the Chief of the SAP loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost sight of the left eye by a fall in July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , after midnight he fell on a glass jar which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he almost ble@@ eds , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again if you &apos;ve fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except combat ...

football : Bv@@ C without R@@ eus in front of Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ tables in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will be missing the leader of the football league in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck will not only change its root position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem keeper Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe League matches in the future , however , Tu@@ chel let himself be open .
with a high likel@@ ihood , he will also play the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final move for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ field@@ player Julian Wei@@ gl is comprehensible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the car fair IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport policy emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rise in digital radio communication .
a test track is currently being established on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks arise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally , for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour is lifted .
in addition , the federal government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the vehicle increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value creation in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly defined .
however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the research organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will win over the next ten years .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey of the digital network of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , any Vi@@ erte wouldn &apos;t leave the car under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis matches
according to present conditions , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf plans to open only singles with the title battle of September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be made by September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained one @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the shooting list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded me of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we &apos;ve become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights are mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star in the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the rarely @-@ sigh@@ ted work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed general workmanship , for which a lot of effort has been carried out : to get the d@@ olls to fr@@ inge , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
the makers have kar@@ ted 14 tons of material according to the Senator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative , fashionable walk@@ ways of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , he said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the throwing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought some of them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry rather than sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long sti@@ cking machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were produced in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en Mach@@ inery .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a greater role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is le@@ aning on past styles , is a growing order potential .
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
gran@@ ary P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
there are almost no private dealers and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up to date in Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , especially economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ inv@@ ents the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine stops small cu@@ cum@@ bers at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
the entertainment Week@@ ly , however , is not about a new movie , but a continuation of 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws are still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management board has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important , since it shows the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal state of the law and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to tackle consumers a significantly higher dose of toxins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of mistaken industrial and environmental policy are passed along with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury that , based on the current limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they keep the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of the plain is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolfgang sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish , particularly in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts especially can cause serious damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health risk for the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written statement by the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power stations expelled more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past year , EU @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
