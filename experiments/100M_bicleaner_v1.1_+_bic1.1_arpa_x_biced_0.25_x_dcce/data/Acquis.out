II ) that the ker@@ b is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the period of non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention .
B ) The organisation and community shall make a provision that the securing measures provided in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such activity .
in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions laid down in this Convention will be applied once again as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or state in question , and any disclosure of such material from this state or state .
this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a knowledge of the military activity , nor does it apply to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs which each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the Community , States or persons subject to their authority , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organisation , the organisation will reimbur@@ se the costs , provided that it has been clari@@ fied beforehand .
the organization bears in any case the cost of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states .
any claim to which the Community or the State shall be asser@@ ted against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or the State for damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident resulting from the implementation of the securing measures under this Convention , shall be governed in accordance with international law .
after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council shall establish that the organisation is not able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to securing measures under this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account what measures have been achieved by the measures applied by the measures applied , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state concerned to take part in the discussion of such matters by the Council .
with the exception of disputes referring to an establishment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal on the request of a party consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and the States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator who presi@@ des over the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not nominated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure applies if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been selected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention shall stand for Non @-@ nuclear Pro@@ state Parties , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and
II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other upon request of one of the Parties to a change in this Convention .
B ) All amendments require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the objective of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of significant amounts of nuclear arsen@@ als of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ es for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a branch off the risk of premature discovery .
to reach the target defined in Article 28 , the material accounting will be used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial restrictions and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the review by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified for the specified seas for a certain period of time .
when conducting their investigations , the organization makes full use of the community security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown of material balance zones .
in the application of its securing measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
( e ) procedures for assessing clusters of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that equi@@ ps core material stocks for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the one @-@ and @-@ off of the material balance zone ;
g ) arrangements which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for the reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the organisation of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope en@@ rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or if this core material or other , produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions laid down in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of core material , which is temporarily not possible or desirable in Article 11 , is to consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The provisions laid down in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and community consent to the fact that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in gram or small amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 if such core material is re@@ usable , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
upon request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es up core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , of these hed@@ ging measures , provided that the total amount of core material delivered by the States in the States at no time amounts to
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of special p@@ alli@@ ble material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 % ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ anium with en@@ rich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization of supple@@ mental agreements which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organization &apos;s successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organisation is required in the individual to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention into force . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the consent between the organisation , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization maintains a consolidated stock list of the entire core material underlying this convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory @-@ list based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action plan established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible , within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other through the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement .
the Organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special transaction account &quot; which the member states contribute to the special action account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organisation is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment occurs in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic notes of the member state , which are to be paid on request in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as administrator of the special action account and to deposit at the deposit of the organisation in the respective country .
B ) the payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to any other between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution on January 1 , 1979 or at any other time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into consideration the dates required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments prior to the dates mentioned above .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator acc@@ esses about proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its other lending capacity to loan terms with no discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly re@@ payable and rapidly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , which is valued , approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices used for the organization funded by the Organization for the purpose of this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 10 years each in 50 years .
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be made directly to the organization that keeps them in place .
each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is given in particular .
the proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided ( i ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to the measure of what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan granted , may be recipients of a specific loan agreement .
return payments of special transactions take place on the special transaction , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the Administr@@ ators shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC for the complete awar@@ ding of all special loans to the E@@ EC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors for the examination by the directors .
during the period of re@@ payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made there@@ for .
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation at this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the E@@ EC sends a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special action account as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and runs suitable records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special action account , the amounts paid out of the account recei@@ pts and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff up to the full issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account , the progress of programmes or plans financed by special deals , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date on which the E@@ EC and the organisation agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the capital paid by the recipients is returned to the Member States in accordance with Article II paragraph 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties thereof are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the conclusion of the procedure in question by the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat shall carry out these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper permit of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is framed in two letters in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each wor@@ ding is equally binding .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to change the An@@ nex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has issued the following AC@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled fusion and plasma @-@ physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program comprises the creation of a large experimental plant , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are to be transferred to a common company in accordance with chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since extensive work is still to be carried out until practical use of controlled fusion confusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement shall enable each contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by combining its research efforts in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for mutual research , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction is faster .
in order to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , here@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program under@@ takes long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or altered by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement so that there may be new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every time the parties adopt a new program , this will take place at the place of the programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realized by : - appropriate participation of any of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme ;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
in the context of the aim of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
with regard to the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties here@@ with conclude an association agreement , which corresponds as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved with the timing of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ s Exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET , the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , the statute of which it accepts .
moreover Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become a contracting partner of any contract , whose objective falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the bodies responsible for carrying out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Convention shall be described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a maximum of two delegates within the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program in the Eur@@ atom program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , carries out this task in respect of all research and development activities that this agreement relates to .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its validity in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common goal set out in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss program as well as to the common objective established in Article 1 of the present agreement , while the scientific and technological developments in the world must be taken into consideration .

I invite you to confirm the consent of the community on these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force on January 1 , 1978 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would agree with the approval of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request .
the agreement could be concluded down to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment rates for member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
in any stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , whereby the possibility of renewal may be exceeded without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit entry fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the dra@@ fts would take place in the currencies at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applied at the time at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market value .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market , the interest rate at the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the correspon@@ dingly increased level of Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trading with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
I commend myself to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are covered as follows :
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina agrees to ensure that the stipul@@ ated amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and / or is carried out according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade is possible , the two parties of this agreement shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the above mentioned above to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community is entitled to the protective cl@@ auses , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to the common market regulated in this agreement is not affected .

the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a top rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the case of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount established under number 2 according to the scope of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account under the number 5 Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ atz of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total quantity referred to as number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23 000 tons of slaughter body weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community will take precau@@ tions in order to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat due to the execution of the ordin@@ ance of the Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ ers and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only given at prices and conditions that are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under number 1 .
in its part , the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products , originating in Argentina , is dependent upon the submission of an export licence issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a security deposit for obtaining the import license for the articles in question .
the regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the association periodi@@ cally shows the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be deco@@ ded according to country of destination .
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly examines the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , the Lamb and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the market conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for the target mentioned under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned collective bar@@ gaining numbers pursuant to the Community .
the Committee discusses all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties under the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount applicable by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year shall be determined in relation to the total annual amount and will account for the seasonal character of trading .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the contract for the establishment of the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in terms of changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would give the consent of your government to this .

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat meat
I commend myself to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , Lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb to the world market and especially after the union for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honour to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is used for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat to access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the stipul@@ ated amounts are carried out in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position in the community &apos;s market .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the surplus above mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution .

in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of she@@ ep@@ skin in the community without any danger to market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ ers and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only given at prices and conditions that are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 in particular by granting no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products originating in New Zealand shall be dependent upon the submission of an export licence issued by the responsible authority appointed by the New Zealand Government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a security deposit for obtaining the import license for the articles in question .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ stlich der Uruguay on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamm@@ ert
I commend myself to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are covered as follows :
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( collective wage 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( collective wage 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Uruguay agrees to ensure that the stipul@@ ated amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade is possible , the two parties of this agreement shall consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the above mentioned above to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community is entitled to the protective cl@@ auses , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to the Community market regulated in this agreement is not affected .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a top rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the case of the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay is changing the amount established under number 2 according to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account under the number 5 Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ atz of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total quantity referred to as number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5 800 tonnes of slaughter body weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community makes arrangements so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ o production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ ers and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only given at prices and conditions that are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under number 1 .
in its part , the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products , originating in Uruguay , is made dependent upon the submission of an export licence issued by the responsible authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in the case of implementing regulations , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community regularly determines the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be deco@@ ded according to country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty on the establishment of the European Economic Community is applied and , on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Austria of Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in terms of changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

the Parties to the European Convention on 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; in order to free the therapeutic substances made available to them by the other parties &quot; from all input donations . &quot;
whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls within the jurisdiction of the Community which , after the Treaty by which it was founded , has the requ@@ is@@ ite powers ;
whereas for the implementation of Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , it is necessary that the European Economic Community can become the contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force for the community on the first day of the month following the signing .
it appears on the first day of the month in force following the day that the last of the contracting parties have deposited their certificate of acceptance by the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This additional protocol , however , appears after the exp@@ iry of two years after the date in force to which it was issued for acceptance , unless one of the contracting parties has noted an objection to its entry into force .
from that point on , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the contracting party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe not@@ ates the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community every adoption or objection in accordance with Article 2 as well as the date of the entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 .
the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any act , notification or communication related to this Convention .
whereas it is highly desirable if the Member States support each other if necessary in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood type determination ,
whereas mutual support is only possible when the composition and use of these re@@ agents are subject to the regulation of the blood group together by the Member States , and the necessary facilities and exceptions are granted for their import@@ ation .
in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood type determination &quot; re@@ agents human , animal , plant and other origins for blood type determination and to determine blood in@@ compati@@ bilities .
any party of the contracting party may limit the use of this Convention to re@@ agents of human origin for the determination of re@@ agents of human origin to the signing of this Convention or in the suspension of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession certificate by an explanation of the use of this Convention on Re@@ agents of Human Orig@@ in .
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by an Noti@@ fication addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the contracting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties which they urgently require , provided they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided to other contracting parties only on condition that there is no gain associated with that they are only used for medical purposes and are only delivered to bodies designated by the governments involved .
each consi@@ gn@@ ment of re@@ agents to blood type determination must be borne by att@@ esting that they have been made according to the regulations of the protocol .
the Protocol and its establishment constitute an administrative agreement that may be amended or supplemented by the governments of the contracting parties of this Convention .
the Parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents made available to them by other contracting parties to determine the blood type determination of all input donations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also take all necessary measures to ensure that these substances reach the recipient quickly and on the shortest path in Article 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties submit to each other via the Secretary General of the Council of Europe a list of places authorised for the issu@@ ance of the certificate envis@@ aged in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the positions designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this agreement is for the members of the Council of Europe for signing up ; they can become the contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ; or
this Convention enters into force one month after the day that three members of the Council have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it in accordance with Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for every member that signs or appro@@ ves or appro@@ ves or appro@@ ves or appro@@ ves this agreement later without reservation or approval , it enters into force one month after his signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
after the entry into force of the Convention , the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe not@@ ates the date of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any party of the contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention in compliance with a period of one year by sending an advertisement to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all blood samples tested , containing an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood flow in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination of most specific@@ s is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te infections .
the ti@@ ter gives the re@@ agent di@@ lution in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination , for which the international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ and anti @-@ B as well as Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the re @-@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the international standard prepar@@ atory or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren , according to definition , contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the international standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ alpha re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is to be approved by the state regulatory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the solvents delivered with dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the conditions for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ es@@ sig or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in a fluid form or after recovery , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels nor visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange should not be d@@ yed arti@@ fici@@ ally as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity required in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood type determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents in the laboratory can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is likely that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective content , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective share .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black printed label is to be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for recovery
furthermore , this label or the label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions included in the containers , contain the following information : 1 . solid name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing

the following requirements regarding the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if International standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain an@@ tigen D .
