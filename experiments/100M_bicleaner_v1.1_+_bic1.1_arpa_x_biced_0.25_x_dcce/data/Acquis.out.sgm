<seg id="696">The objective of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the divergence of significant amounts of nuclear arsenals of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear wares for unknown purposes as well as deterrence from such a branch off the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To reach the target defined in Article 28, the material accounting will be used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance, composite with spatial restrictions and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the review by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity, which is not proven for a certain period of time, is specified for the specified seas for a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="699">When conducting their investigations, the organization makes full use of the community security system after Article 3.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown of material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of its securing measures, the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expedient:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved, produced, lost, lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) the evaluation of the reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of the measurement uncertainty;</seg>
<seg id="704">C) procedures for determination, testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transmitters and receivers;</seg>
<seg id="705">(e) procedures for assessing clusters of non-measured inventories and non-measured losses;</seg>
<seg id="706">F) a protocol and reporting system that equips core material stocks for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory, including the one-and-off of the material balance zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">G) arrangements which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) Procedure for the reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thorium-containing material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c), is introduced into the states, so the organisation of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not implemented for specific non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaving core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured, or if this core material or other, produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states, it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The provisions laid down in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled, the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of core material, which is temporarily not possible or desirable in Article 11, is to consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The provisions laid down in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the pre-requisites mentioned in Article 13, provided that the organisation and community consent to the fact that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">Upon request of the Community, the organization exempts the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in gram or small amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) core material if it is used in non-nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 if such core material is reusable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of plutonium-238 which is over 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">Upon request of the Community, the organisation frees up core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention, of these hedging measures, provided that the total amount of core material delivered by the States in the States at no time amounts to</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of special pallible material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) uranium with enrichment of 0.2% (20%) and above, calculated by multiplication of its weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) uranium with enrichment, which lies under 0.2 (20%) and above the natural uranium, calculates by multiplication of its weight with the fivefold square of enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with an enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) 20 metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures under this Convention, precautions are taken for the reapplication of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organization of supplemental agreements which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organization's successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organisation is required in the individual to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention into force. the organisation, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this period requires the consent between the organisation, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report, the organization maintains a consolidated stock list of the entire core material underlying this convention in the states, regardless of its origin, and carries out this inventory-list based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action plan established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and, as far as possible, within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other through the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Organization establishes a special account under the name "Special transaction account" which the member states contribute to the special action account in accordance with this agreement (in this capacity the organisation is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment occurs in the form of cash or intrinsic notes of the member state, which are to be paid on request in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as administrator of the special action account and to deposit at the deposit of the organisation in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) the payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to any other between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution on January 1, 1979 or at any other time, which was agreed between the EEC and the bailiff, taking into consideration the dates required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may wish to make payments prior to the dates mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator accesses about proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its other lending capacity to loan terms with no discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Any special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly repayable and rapidly repayable development program or project (including a sectoral plan), which is valued, approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices used for the organization funded by the Organization for the purpose of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in 10 years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch are to be made directly to the organization that keeps them in place.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the means is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided (i) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and which, according to the measure of what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan granted, may be recipients of a specific loan agreement.</seg>
<seg id="752">Return payments of special transactions take place on the special transaction, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Administrators shall instruct the EEC for the complete awarding of all special loans to the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors for the examination by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of repayment of the special transaction loans, the administrator shall instruct the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made therefor.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditor of the organisation at this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loans, the administrator of the EEC sends a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special action account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and runs suitable records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special action account, the amounts paid out of the account receipts and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the bailiff up to the full issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account, the progress of programmes or plans financed by special deals, and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date on which the EEC and the organisation agree, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the capital paid by the recipients is returned to the Member States in accordance with Article II paragraph 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties thereof are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
