this document is a summary of the European Public Monitoring Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ia nerv@@ ousness ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe , man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for taking or the melting tablets can be used in patients who trouble swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are just as degra@@ ded as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears above all as a &quot; partial agonists &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing her recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms was investigated in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was investigated .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resor@@ bed to the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients up to 74 weeks , and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , nausea , nausea , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . , a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and responded to their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ vol@@ u@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ i@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia performing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with out@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
taking into account the combined application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and similar dose reductions should be performed .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the can height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ y@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Var@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the lack of data for safety in humans and because of the concerns arising in reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ kl@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ isie , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to those treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment was 2@@ 3,5 % .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their appearance reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder about the combination of a partial diag@@ on@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor , and a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1 receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the put@@ t .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients holding a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured values defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with Chr@@ onic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher return rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was estimated at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ extra@@ extra@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . )
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms for over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a preservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also reported in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ apse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the hydro@@ xi@@ fication and hydro@@ xi@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination season is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 14@@ 6 hours in poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ x of mid @-@ level ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ fold of the average intake state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the middle steam state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

in an O@@ extra@@ extra@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . )
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic was compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ fold of the middle steam State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the middle steam state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ vol@@ u@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ i@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia performing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a m@@ um are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ran@@ ate was higher compared to the one @-@ off dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was intra@@ muscular and simultaneously received Lor@@ raine ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist F@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the can height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events were reported more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ on@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their appearance reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of the a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients holding a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured values defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher return rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) was shown at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ extra@@ extra@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients enrolled in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extended in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ apse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
in the first two hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application during a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were intra@@ muscular in 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns were revealed after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ ker@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of the central steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the mean stead@@ fast @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the central steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used to receive an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , 2@@ 29 patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who breast@@ feed or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who failed to have first @-@ line metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved at Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adaptation in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in the patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be induced until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women of child@@ bearing age , who do not practise effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation prior to treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect traffic and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most noticeable ha@@ em@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue @-@ burning , dry mouth , pain in the g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an In@@ timi@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active substance that promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in facilitates the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ doc@@ annab@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ inal receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ inal protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved non @-@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 , as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a deterior@@ ated general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The outcomes for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients with &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
Neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who were experiencing a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were measured in clinical studies .
the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or band@@ aging of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , pac@@ lit@@ axel &apos;s pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary elimination of the unchanged active substance is 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ abol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , suggest@@ ing a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine , and as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be taken when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is slowly inj@@ ected using a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market is provided by medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
• Training bro@@ sch@@ ure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing insert . • With clear imaging of the correct usage of the product , cool cool@@ ers for transport through the patients .
this means that se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels , in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion if a self @-@ blood donation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with conditions for which the medicine is shown .
ab@@ u@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood don@@ or .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems an an@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which makes it capable of forming epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ et@@ amed was compared with the reference veter@@ inary when administered as an injection into a vein in a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
in all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before either om@@ itted or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of placebo @-@ moul@@ ded ab@@ et@@ amed were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to depar@@ tures were to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ sen@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
they may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of ren@@ al problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces stre@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of the stre@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiac status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in planned larger surgical interventions that require large blood volume compensation ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except in pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and as a result vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required .
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in for more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values may occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a suitable dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 0.@@ 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required .
in view of these hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a suitable dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ emia .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ pro@@ cal coefficient increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reci@@ pro@@ cal coefficient of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) has increased three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the reaction factor of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , an appeal to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 @-@ 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme begins - large iron reserves are available before the start of the abor@@ tion therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who suffer from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ et@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ sis ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the lo@@ oting or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA following months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of efficacy ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reci@@ pro@@ cal value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum oxidation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated .
if the reci@@ pro@@ cal value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the counter @-@ ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marks for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weighed .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ u@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended in maintenance therapy should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the administration of epo@@ e@@ tin , if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumour patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has to be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dose adaptation with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are provided for a larger electrical orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment .
patients undergoing extensive elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular disease , particularly in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it is not possible to exclude that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can per@@ sist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .

if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , neur@@ ys@@ ms , retin@@ thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ ids .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate percentage with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated with an@@ a@@ emia due to several common malign@@ ancies consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa regulation after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than serum levels which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels stay the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the authorisation has to supply the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Training bro@@ sch@@ ure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing insert .
the owner of the marketing permit has to make sure that the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and is operational in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug used in traffic is used .
the owner of the marketing authorization agrees to conduct the studies and additional measures for the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance specified in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as defined in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1 8.@@ 2. and according to each subsequent Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information , which could have an impact on the current safety specifications , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by E@@ MEA
• In a month before your treatment you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or reinforced breast pain ) , the risk of bleeding in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - if , for example , such blood cl@@ ots occurred earlier .
you suffer serious circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical canal ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ) . you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed it can lead to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which forms again after further treatment .
your doctor may periodi@@ cally check out regular blood tests to check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or follow @-@ acid deficiency should be considered and treated with depar@@ tures before the start of the therapy .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ te after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ et@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , ab@@ u@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed until the potassium levels lie in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of ab@@ et@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your blood @-@ dy@@ e levels ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your dose of the blood to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully towards the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Out@@ go@@ amed act like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before treatment begins and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get the stre@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medications , or if they have been taken / used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ et@@ amed , your doctor may order certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means to establish the immune system , for example in cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted roughly every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works right and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of depar@@ tures between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia approaches the treatment , the dose can be adjusted roughly every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ et@@ amed yourself under the skin .

eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ ck ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that not enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution in the use of ab@@ et@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can - irrespective of the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed - lead to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events .
the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed can be accompanied by an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your starting ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in is too high

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered from a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as with the h@@ ind ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis for more than 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years has been studied .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta has been tested in two studies with a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to the ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ ys side @-@ effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta can not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die @-@ off of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides information material to physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit issued by Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the placing of A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union .

o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care
o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in women with post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended since there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ c@@ emia should be treated with intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ c@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental implants , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases reported as severe side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron is associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the variation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis for more than three years between the cla@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine in 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the patients &quot; hom@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local responses to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been regularly reported , especially in cancer patients , over o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area with a patient with A@@ cla@@ sta and in a patient treated with placebo .
in case of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ c@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate intraven@@ ously .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) were measured with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the fem@@ al dog ≤ -@@ 1,5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta were significantly reduced over a period of three years , and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta demonstrated a consistent effect over three years resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar spine of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip decreased by 6.@@ 0 % , the neck @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic crest .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased compared to placebo treatment by the BM@@ D on the overall pen@@ cils and thi@@ ghs at all times .
compared to the placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in the overall pen@@ al and 4.3 % on the neck @-@ neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 study ) , compared to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , the once @-@ weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cla@@ sta has been examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mostly light to moder@@ ately heavy @-@ ey@@ ed pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared with the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( addressed to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study of 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma was rapidly reduced to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ and 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long eli@@ xi@@ ation phase with a terminal elimination @-@ dur@@ al period t ½ γ 14@@ 6 hours .
the early dividing phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours you will find 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a decreased clearing of metabol@@ ised substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron &apos;s acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only contains limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight in rats .
for studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in rats was measured by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to 7@@ times of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an attack that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ resor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of degra@@ ded serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was achieved .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron is a representative of a class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the hom@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta acts by normal@@ ising bone reconstruction again , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation , giving the bone another strength .
if you are in dental treatment or need to undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , chem@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they are damaging the kidneys .
when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drinks , you should be aware that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient amounts of fluid before and after the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta if you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( for more than 30 % of patients ) , but less common in subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
at present it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta .
physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
over allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , chem@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice side effects not listed in this information .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions right up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be adequately treated with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a transi@@ ent , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ c@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , in accordance with at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted on more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking compared to a placebo .
the studies on smoking setting did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia found during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is to be found in the package supplement .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause suicide in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable with con@@ current use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

this document is a summary of the European Public Monitoring Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acet@@ yl@@ c@@ emia , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
for more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ gia was investigated ; patients received a combination of Met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either acet@@ ylene or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar values were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ t study , the effect of an additional administration of acet@@ ylene and sul@@ fon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study evaluating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high concentration levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that , as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available to use Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attacks or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcomes study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other symptoms of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach problems , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision whether treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should continue until the laboratory parameters are preceded by clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be accumulated by fatty deposits and in some cases connected to fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , slight reduction of mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity there is a risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy .
after the market launch , diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported or worsen@@ ed in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a female wishes a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin @-@ insul@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the chan@@ g@@ or and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ tig@@ ege also frequently performed as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was reported .
since its market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7.@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ oc@@ ation .
over a period of 3.5 years in the Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms oc@@ cured .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it was shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ sic as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ azi@@ di ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was adequately adjusted with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabe@@ tics in a small group of 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as marginal , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total blood matrix gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ sic and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison with placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas values decreased under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ sic .
in a study more than 20 weeks pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hyper@@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both in terms of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcomes study , 5@@ 52 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually are reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the middle plasma @-@ elimination period of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys matched the plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin @-@ insul@@ a@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( with male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ites led to an increased frequency of col@@ on@@ tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ sic respectively .
in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study more than 20 weeks pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hyper@@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both in effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target with regard to their primary end@@ point , which resulted in a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , coron@@ ary ar@@ re@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vit@@ ul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood glucose levels were significantly lowered as compared to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of the package contents ) .
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA vs. insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other drugs taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can cause un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and cause temporary or permanent brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood glucose control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually rever@@ sible .
5 . however , an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia associated with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration amounts to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or ret@@ ar@@ ded resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not show any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane ej@@ ector is removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin can rise to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is used for the first use according to the instructions for use .
some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id cans need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be re@@ ared , and then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adaptation is required when changing to acet@@ one in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that an intraven@@ ously given Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id reduced the mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pla@@ ques ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystal deposits which can lead to joints and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per Dez@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to take other medicines at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) was compared .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both trials , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients , who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80@@ mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of adverse events related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ ity in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including a medical history known or currently available and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum har@@ n@@ wort is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose elevation on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account daily .
in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , as there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other medicines that have been har@@ n@@ essed , it can lead to acute arthritis in the beginning of the treatment , because the reduction of the serum har@@ n@@ wort can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissues .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that there is a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct interactions with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ one level ( a in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous offering of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adaptation for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study of subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x measured a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid shower containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de ( about 1 hour ) delays and decreases the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be concluded on the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or carrying out dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time using Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally .

the reduction of serum har@@ n@@ wort sugar to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum carot@@ ene values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .

with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage reg@@ ression of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .

the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the sustained reduction of serum har@@ n@@ wort levels at &lt; 0.@@ 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the top grades up to month 24 .
higher T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

for cases between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma red binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first eating of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the increase of the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed for preventing bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blown abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic rep@@ elling .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. to author@@ ise AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie ahead of the first eating of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , must be given only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms pointing to potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ slu@@ gg@@ ale pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation continue .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at there was no increased risk , rarely ( after market launch ) Ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men contains predominantly IV administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the treatment of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients needing a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet next morning while taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled week of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ters continued to increase ; also , the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % vs Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours prior to commen@@ cing a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not result in clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

although there are no clinical data available , it is still to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone can be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ ph is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent transplan@@ ted organ transplan@@ ts from the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms as well as data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , while the application of Adv@@ anc@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining , for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more and more studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investigated how adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph is included in the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , advance law may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with advance , as the advance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should be performed only under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formula , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ an@@ Kit should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood mirror regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switch @-@ over .
day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adjustment of the sto@@ cking can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral consumption in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intraven@@ ously initiated ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection must be maintained for immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Pre@@ vention of Gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advocate therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be performed twice daily dosage of Progra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ anc@@ e. this switch has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs to adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t should start for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are switched to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients although there is no clinical experience with an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , transplan@@ ted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with limited ren@@ al function Since the ren@@ al function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine absorption and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy , be careful ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ula controls .
it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ blood @-@ level mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the seb@@ ac@@ eous levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood stem from 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should be performed only under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph are still available .
in order to proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided during a treatment with advance law ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy designated as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore occur under adv@@ an@@ a@@ y@@ opathy .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders include an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
as Adv@@ anc@@ ake contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special care is advised .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while simultaneously offering substances which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ ctions and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal tests have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not provide any indication that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born can be recommended for possible adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not estimated ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases like other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ als ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
because of its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be conveyed by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the accumulation of the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent im@@ itation of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the T cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

lung Transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multi@@ center trial with oral Progra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ um and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , there were in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the development of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly higher ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients transferred from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Top@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi@@ centre study with oral program was performed on 205 patients receiving pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation based on a random@@ ised trial of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml of the 5 .
color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Progra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a reinforcement of the metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly done via bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than in Progra@@ f in stable patients treated by Progra@@ f ( once daily ) at 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) ratio to the full day dose .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a due to lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from a human plasma but is produced according to a method referred to as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which makes it capable of forming the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding was evaluated in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ des with &quot; excellent &quot; resp@@ . &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ance may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ul@@ ant Factor VI@@ II , m@@ aus@@ oleum or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for placing lawyers across the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following here@@ tical events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment process , appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II @-@ plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ life times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directional Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is largest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in the case of previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood coag@@ ulation was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , no 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) had a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As for other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of the factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially granted the CH@@ MP ) Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for the transfer of Adv@@ enti@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
advocate could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who joined Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changing drug release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in view of all the lo@@ cu@@ ff symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported about a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who alone received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , oral drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) , do not apply .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dosis ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze on the whole of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without sh@@ red@@ ding , breaking up or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms die .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , because with long @-@ term use , the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued if necessary with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before the performance of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent .
as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with lor@@ ran@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether it was either alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate is an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a presum@@ ption that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic efficiency or the capacity to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible portals .

a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules &apos; P @-@ selection to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence compared to placebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can indu@@ ce other symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , where 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total live scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the dimin@@ ishing effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ tic application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers , it was found that four subjects were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine angi@@ ogen@@ ic was equivalent to exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , do not show any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and during the product on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and watering or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , it was very rare to report cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle aches , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver disease has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 m@@ l. of sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by investigating the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application with children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo .
in both trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline of the symptom score after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
ap@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current course of disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed .
during the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended for the patients during the allergic period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while consuming ap@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to he@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic efficiency or the capacity to operate machinery .
in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth drying ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adolescents from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules &apos; P @-@ selection to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ap@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s will be defined as the appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively rec@@ ited .
since hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria will lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations provided by the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the rate of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vi@@ gil@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient &apos;s bi@@ ographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant grief after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a comparable degree of exposure to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not show any particular dangers to humans .

ap@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with e@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and related laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that can be metabol@@ ised is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in an adult and adol@@ escent dose of up to 45 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came into question for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily dose of fatigue of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
as the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5@@ mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets did not affect psych@@ omot@@ ors in adults and adolescents in clinical studies .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was not possible to increase alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively decrease the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the proliferation of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several single dose studies , the fact that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .

in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that were used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily lay in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets for children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the classification of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , form@@ ulations were equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

A@@ eri@@ us solution for entry is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution for entering an application sy@@ ringe for preparation to take with sc@@ aling is included , you can use it as an alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rhe@@ a , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , frequent side effects while adults were reported ti@@ redness , mouth @-@ drying and head@@ aches more often than with placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with child safe cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or application sy@@ ringe for preparation for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company re@@ jects its application for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is supposed to protect against a strain of the flu virus causing a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human , because humans do not yet have an immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as a &quot; alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster when it comes to contact with a flu virus .
afterwards , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA Gui@@ delines for Pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
ast@@ er@@ ase should only be decre@@ ed if the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ regeneration depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of infections and diseases connected with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ampli@@ fied drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to use prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few responded to treatment by the children who used to be treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who used to be treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , this drug , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , lowered viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as much as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it was possible to decrease the viral load after four weeks after four weeks as with the patients who took their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded as well as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of aging in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weighed the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic rein@@ for@@ cer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing as@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es amounts to 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of azi@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients with moderate liver function distur@@ b@@ ance should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ other@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with azi@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of a@@ we with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma gas of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to evaluate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should be monitored on op@@ i@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be dropped to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that were required to provide medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time when an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines , whose active agents are primarily metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the in@@ fi@@ virus levels and , if possible , examine the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % decreased when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the plas@@ min values of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the fantasy component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ ave lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore the dose of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require any dose adaptation .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when these medicines are used , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ast@@ er@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in increasing the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below include sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interact .
the patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions related to these drugs if they are used in combination with ast@@ er@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as it may cause resor@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at test persons , the fluor@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time as am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is advised with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while applying ag@@ rot@@ ase .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ rot@@ ase , stronger control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as ag@@ it@@ asis ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were mild to moderate , and were early on and rarely lead to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines applied to the HIV treatment at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and occurred with more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study of PRO@@ F@@ 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) were found in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ car@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception formed increases in the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received al@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r very frequently .
in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ formation stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosing regi@@ mens - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ed regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ cured patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children , where vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those found in adults .

results based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of resistance tests .
each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) appear .
on the other hand , Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study conducted with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side hal@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ nine ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ statement threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of untreated ather@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , 152 of whom were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given simultaneously ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in the optimisation of treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg of a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , will probably remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bon@@ ded am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall dosage concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously when given simultaneously with a@@ we ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily routine diagnosis as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules , hence A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney dysfunction is likely to be minor on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were used in male animals in doses of 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily injection of 1200 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be observed and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the treatment was finished .
studies on toxic@@ ity with juven@@ iles who were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate delayed development , were observed in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es amounts to 20 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with a low or minor liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in the long run 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the plas@@ min values of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
when these medicines are used , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at test persons , the fluor@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ rot@@ ase , stronger control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both ac@@ utely and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration in the optimisation of treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bon@@ ded am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall dosage concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously when given simultaneously with a@@ we ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney dysfunction is likely to be minor on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were used in male animals in doses of 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily injection of 1200 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ e @-@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity with juven@@ iles who were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the Met@@ abol@@ ism channels are not fully mature , so that Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are not fully mature .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion was not documented in patients with PI previously treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for taking in ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to take in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with azi@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be suspended in the long term , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous A@@ gener@@ ase intake can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and cause associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s oral administration expects significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by inhal@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines applied to the HIV treatment at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosing regi@@ mens - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ed regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a 60 treatment is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in the optimisation of treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg of a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed on a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate delayed development , were observed in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses .
if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . - This drug was prescribed for you personally .
it may harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to use A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect of ag@@ rot@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on your individual viral resistance test and your treatment pre@@ history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above conditions or taking any of the above drugs .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for strengthening the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure that before beginning of treatment you have carefully read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for ampli@@ fication in children from 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body@@ weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you begin taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control bleeding . − For patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .
if you have certain medicines that can cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under no circumstances to prevent HIV transmission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no studies on the influence of ag@@ rot@@ ase on driving capability or the capacity to beam machines have been carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you are suffering from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ag@@ rot@@ ase can be reduced .
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that taking Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
it is very important that you take the entire daily dose prescribed by your doctor .
if you have taken a larger amount of A@@ gener@@ ase than you should have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist right away .
if you forgot the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase , if you forgot the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think of it and then continue taking the intake as before .
in the treatment of HIV infection , it is not always possible to say whether any side effects are caused by A@@ gener@@ ase , through other medicines that are taken simultaneously or caused by the HIV infection itself .
headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , disease feeling , vom@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be a serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to placebo ( the same cream but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo performed either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete healing rate was between 15 % and 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with placebo .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
to be put on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream is to continue until all visible additions have disappeared in the genital or per@@ imeter region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only healed completely , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ed the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
in a thin layer , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is to be applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied areas infected with soap , until the cream is fully drawn .
in these patients an evaluation should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a cord leading to circumc@@ ision .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream in higher doses than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ected means for treating external infections in the genital and per@@ imeter area have not yet been clinical experiences .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of genital de@@ duction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of bi@@ ases .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od inside 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the treatment has ended .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ oma .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experiences are available , therefore the application is not recommended in case of pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or in the lip area within the lab@@ ial .
very limited data about the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this purpose , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after replacing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a less complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the release or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) cannot be quanti@@ fiable after a single or several topical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related adverse events in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the area of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side @-@ effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial report are shown below .
the most common , as likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to the side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were listed below .
this study , according to study plan , shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies , three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / off @-@ blade ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this study , according to study plan , shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the occasional unique oral recording of 200 m@@ g. of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia , and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was significantly superior regarding a complete recovery of the genital war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of patients in total with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients , the patients were completely cured ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for five @-@ day use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical radi@@ otherapy after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external fen@@ u@@ stain@@ s , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials against children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of pharmaceutical drugs at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hours half @-@ life time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on T@@ MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years , comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects on the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice received no tumours in the application for three days a week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being to view as very low due to the systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme substitute therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with recovery equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining the effect of reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion location .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known and , where necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B@@ V a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme substitute therapy in patients with advanced diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect arising during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ ational equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies is immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery after a longer period of inter@@ ruption , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded by an inter@@ ruption of treatment due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rates to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
as there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended that the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not breast@@ feeding .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 trial and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing problems and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe trial and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment was started ( after 26 days versus 45 days versus 45 days in patients at age 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) , there were no immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients in which it was never released into Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with a low to low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine whereas a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was as@@ cer@@ tained in patients with high antibody ti@@ res@@ ins .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme substitute therapy lies in a sufficient recovery of enzyme activity for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function compared to the placebo arm , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in view of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected pro@@ centric normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe wa@@ ve@@ form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental develop@@ mental speed after the Z score for this age group .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a one @-@ time offering , toxic@@ ity with repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not show any particular danger to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , taken off or the dose decreased .
the active form of fixed fixed s@@ lows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to place in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer period of life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta took longer survival compared to the comparison drug .
September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. an approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each glass bottle must be dissolved with a 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ - sis is taken from the ep @-@ through bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant tissue epitheli@@ al hi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ or , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ating plate epitheli@@ al hi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after every third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under the recovery of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop ill @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ C@@ 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 or so@@ - fort scale 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 and above , compared to patients aged 65 years .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients have to be monitored with regard to bone sar@@ c@@ isation and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cell count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ alization , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ cot@@ ic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) for at least 2 days before treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients designated for therapy with fixed fixed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure , or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally if this ingredient is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this ino@@ cul@@ ation is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
given the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible fo@@ aming of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be advised against the treatment - G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed secre@@ tion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
there is no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
fixed fixed may not be used during pregnancy , unless it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
given the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by interrup@@ ting wi@@ ch@@ - and fol@@ lic@@ ant metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ hi@@ at with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine @-@ dri@@ b@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate key enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ lins .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in the context of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the alone C@@ is@@ cop@@ h@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy used medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study showed efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who are taking All@@ i and after 12 weeks no weight loss should be noted , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats that are fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60@@ mg show an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ eces , stools , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fa@@ xes ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where there is not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ der@@ ial , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there are not enough data about efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to minimal , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctuations in pregnancy to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma gas was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained .
however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mental vitamin supplement prior to bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin up@@ take ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the administration of a one @-@ off dose of ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertainty .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to con@@ vul@@ sions with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid re @-@ formation of any systemic effects caused by the inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding of the active Ser@@ ine @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atical li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies , it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fatty @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both trials , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average total in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be demonstrated spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of an accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic absor@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine Group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not cause any particular danger to humans .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used in overweight adults aged 18 years with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or overweight in relation to your body size .
even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a check@@ up .
for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose during a diet , you can lose one additional kilogra@@ m using all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs or have taken a short time , even if it is not a prescription drug .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood @-@ th@@ inning effect .
oral contrac@@ eption and all@@ i • The effect of oral induction of contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or canc@@ eled if you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking all@@ i and if you have medicines for high blood pressure , as the dosage may need to be adjusted .
for more information on the blue pages in section 6 , see Other helpful information on the blue pages .
if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , risk associated accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet prior to the first capsule intake .
food di@@ aries are effective , as you can easily understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your dietary habits .
in order to safely reach your target weight , you should specify two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Do fat @-@ du@@ ed to reduce the likel@@ ihood of eating @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y during the intake and after the intake of all@@ i physically active .
• If you cannot determine any reduction in weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
under certain circumstances , you must stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not a matter of changing the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily discharge , sudden or aug@@ mented stool ( soft fa@@ eces ) are due to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions indicate the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , sweat out@@ breaks , r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , swelling of the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in more than 1 out of 10 people taking all@@ i . • flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily leave • Smo@@ king chair • Soft fa@@ eces inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or you significantly impaired .
common side effects These can occur at 1 out of 10 people who are taking all@@ i . • stomach ( abdominal ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( stool ) • more aqu@@ eous / liquid stool • increased chair drive • Appe@@ al inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or you significantly impaired .
it is not known how frequently these effects occur . • In@@ cre@@ ase certain liver enzyme values • In@@ cre@@ ase blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who use war@@ far@@ in or other blood @-@ th@@ inning medications ( anti@@ coag@@ ulating ) drugs .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice side effects not specified in this use information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment begins , as at this time you might have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional side effects : • Beg@@ inner already a few days , or better one week , before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit is decreasing . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial night@@ stand , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children in@@ accessible . • Do not store any use after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date shown on the cart@@ on . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
swallow this in any case . • You can carry your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart Disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the onset of serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as labelling on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the information below , which is suitable for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the mode of action of the capsule , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of eating @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually increase gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low @-@ physical activity &quot; means that you are daily doing little or no stairs , work stairs , work in the garden or other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can exercise 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sinn@@ ful is a nutrition journal with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .

Alo@@ ha is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ ha can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ ha was studied at 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ op@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ op@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for the marketing of al@@ oh@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ ha is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer illness and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with medi@@ cally eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ oh@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cal ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute isch@@ emia should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agonists , caution is advisable with the simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ ha should not be used to prevent nor treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron dose and a fer@@ rite @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous offering of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( acet@@ am@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of using pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least probably were associated with al@@ oh@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar abund@@ ances of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in treating an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies 1,@@ 132 patients who received a medi@@ cally eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate , and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of bent@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportion@@ ately in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
after IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was between day 1 and day 5 at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days was comparable with the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the iso@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous in@@ jek@@ tion in healthy eyes , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function distur@@ b the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered to be sufficiently close to the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications pointed out that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ on channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of the action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ ha is determined for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the announcement of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same veter@@ an ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage causes damage , and the values of the liver enzyme of Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are standard in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active ingredient .
the Al@@ ph@@ eon company presented data confirming the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the effectiveness of the reference resin .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int .
further concerns were expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease bri@@ gh@@ tened again with more patients than in the case of the reference veter@@ inary . Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the investig@@ ational test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug contains an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of be@@ peti@@ go ( a skin infection with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ aries ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ ma may not work against this kind of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin area to be treated must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients with placebo talked to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ ine , about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( breast @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the ordering site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were predomin@@ ant in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ aries , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd a permit for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Accor@@ ding to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after topical application of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding will continue or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued or terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials on 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the meeting place , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interaction and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ ome sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , advice should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 separated skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina IC IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tivity liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ cores for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ im@@ planted skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development of development ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were established .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between the ages of one and fifteen years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end by two doses .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by assisting the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambient rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ination approved by Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination schedule .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix abst@@ ain from identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in six months and at a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan for the basic di@@ mming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent individuals who responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination would need a boo@@ ster vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected from immun@@ ological memory with no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , insufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels may not be reached after pri@@ ming , so that additional doses may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact failure in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may , as an exception , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously , as in these cases intra@@ muscular administration may lead to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ro@@ cking vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this wor@@ ding in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ edness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ ck@@ age and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants ranging from 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and toxic@@ ity on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the participants who had given Ambi@@ ence had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of matching was comparable to pro @-@ volume ( i.e. over the entire vaccine rate at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ edness was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ tious group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ of@@ combin@@ ant with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was exp@@ and@@ able , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix for hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both trials , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ A A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year at the same time was administered with the boo@@ ster of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the current formulation as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after resor@@ ption of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through viral @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as through bathing in water @-@ poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ante can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines is already infected / is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has already occurred with you / your child for an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly protect hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface agent ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the response is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated and / or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / has or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case , the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate locations and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not given up unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ s frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 kno@@ cked doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • headache • appetite loss
♦ s frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 kno@@ cked doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that are very rare for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 kno@@ cked doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP agreed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia - divided among several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without substance ) .
am@@ mo@@ p can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or flavour conversion , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ wealth was admitted under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage already mani@@ f@@ ests itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ ine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution .
since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of the patients and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an anor@@ ect@@ al patient who had a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ c@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an un@@ inten@@ tional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of taken sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occur@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself caused even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life to death .
due to hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ ric secre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is en@@ capsul@@ ated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied for cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected in the plasma following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the medi@@ an acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ ia or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ ine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ tur@@ tles were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyramid @-@ cells of the brain @-@ bark occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an anor@@ ect@@ al patient who had a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ c@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
bi@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ yl glut@@ amine in patients with mal@@ functioning of the ure@@ a cycle , it is assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ y@@ rat is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly even in treatment , and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neurological condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can save the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of up to 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
when laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs or have taken a short time , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , stopping the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions have also been observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room at once for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

30 If laboratory tests are carried out by you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs or have taken a short time , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should intake AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or via a stomach @-@ fi@@ st@@ let@@ oe ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose leading through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ ap@@ ed measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ ops gran@@ ulate out of the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , such as inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in the sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI they often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - was just as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ vit@@ ul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for placing angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency interventions or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
in the case of a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous intake of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to decrease the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the intake dose is rapidly given intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function limitation ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us was administered without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 It is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to active hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible irrit@@ ation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is restored to the level existing before treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units ) , it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ dine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked regularly .
the experimental studies are insufficient regarding the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or et@@ ox@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ dy@@ ru@@ din group and the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point range requiring radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed ha@@ em@@ or@@ al@@ isations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ dy@@ ru@@ din group and the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is immediately terminated and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to the signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both to the cataly@@ tic center and to the ani@@ on bond region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thereby its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in itself is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
moreover , a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) could indu@@ ce a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the three treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or which cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from insulin analog , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to handle insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined by 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amounted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ ines or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the upper leg or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion into the abdominal area .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active force , the brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of manufacture can result in a change in the insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from one patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin @-@ used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ pyramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic acid , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and reserves , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ party regulation can be weakened or missing .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin discharge occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are sorted according to system class categories and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , he@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes of vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Op@@ ens to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the operation time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin ul@@ is@@ in showed a proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal achieves a comparable post@@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as given with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - o@@ ves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
