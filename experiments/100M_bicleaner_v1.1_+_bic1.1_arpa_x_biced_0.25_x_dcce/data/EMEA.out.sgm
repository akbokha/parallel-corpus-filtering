<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Monitoring Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • bipolar I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexia nervousness) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe, manic episodes and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution for taking or the melting tablets can be used in patients who trouble swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are just as degraded as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably appears above all as a "partial agonists" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole works like 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing her recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was investigated in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, suffering from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared to that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbed to the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients up to 74 weeks, and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), nausea, nausea, nausea, drowsiness (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disruption, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., a permit for the placing of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and responded to their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, hypovoluaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs or hypertension (including aczeliated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia performing with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis occur in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, had patients who were treated with Aripiprazole an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazzol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania as a result of comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, where weight gain is known as a side-effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with outlying side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically unrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and that is why similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Taking into account the combined application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects, and similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the can height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethymorphine / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Varfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the lack of data for safety in humans and because of the concerns arising in reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parklinsonism, acathisie, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment was 23,5%.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their appearance reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate overdosage with Aripiprazole alone observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose since Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder about the combination of a partial diagonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, and a moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and in the putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients holding a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured values defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with Chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher return rate for Aripiprazole was estimated at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oextraextrain controlled, multinational double blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.)</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms for over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I-disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a preservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also reported in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially were not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase for 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the hydroxification and hydroxiation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination season is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in poor '(= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10x of mid-level steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3fold of the average intake state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazole not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11x of the middle steam state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically attached, treatment with Aripiprazzol injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimise variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify's melting tablets or Abilify's solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agitibility and behavioural disorders, which were caused differently from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazzol injection solution, patients should be observed in extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxicity (prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, hypovoluaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs or hypertension (including aczeliated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia performing with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mum are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania as a result of comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedranate was higher compared to the one-off dose of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was intramuscular and simultaneously received Lorraine (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Fotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In case of CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor ') metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the can height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events were reported more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical studies (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Elevations of CPK (creatine phosphonkinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their appearance reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant significant improvements of agitibility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitibility and behavioural disturbances, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of the agitibility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggibility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients holding a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured values defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher return rate for Aripiprazole (oral) was shown at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Oextraextrain controlled, multinational double-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients enrolled in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially were not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extended in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first two hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazl AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time to reach maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazole injections was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application during a systemic exposure (AUC), which were intramuscular in 15- or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application, no safety-related concerns were revealed after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies using Aripiprazole (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated application, toxicity, genotoxicity and cankerogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans; therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of the central steady-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times of the mean steadfast-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation prior to treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequently) that can affect traffic and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most noticeable haematologic toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue-burning, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an Intimicrotubuli-active substance that promotes the formation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin facilitates the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendocannabale transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminal receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminal protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of metastatic breast carcinoma for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved non-linked studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2, as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a deteriorated general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% for metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The outcomes for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients with &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who were experiencing a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Exposure Exposure Exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or bandaging of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, paclitaxel's pharmacokinetic properties were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">After the Abraxane administration, the clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary elimination of the unchanged active substance is 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, suggesting a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine, and as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be taken when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that seamed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels, in which complications could occur in connection with a blood transfusion if a self-blood donation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abetamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with conditions for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">Abuamed is injected into a vein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donor.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems an anemia may be caused by an erythropoietindeficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which makes it capable of forming epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abetamed was compared with the reference veterinary when administered as an injection into a vein in a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">In all patients participating in this study, Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before either omitted or received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of placebo-moulded abetamed were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to departures were to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side-effect of Absenamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">They may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiac status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in planned larger surgical interventions that require large blood volume compensation (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except in pediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and as a result vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin for more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values may occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobin variability, a suitable dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 0.6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by means of intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of these hemoglobin variability, a suitable dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reciprocal coefficient increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rose &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reciprocal coefficient of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) has increased three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) resp. the reaction factor of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline, an appeal to the epoetin alfa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33-39%), where the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation programme begins - large iron reserves are available before the start of the abortion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of the dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from the treatment with any erythropoetin in a erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive abetamed or other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembosis).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the looting or cerebrovascular illness; in patients with recently occurred cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA following months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of efficacy (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reciprocal value should be determined and the usual causes of non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum oxidation, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reciprocal value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is degraded (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the counter-erythropoietin-antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marks for diagnosis of a PRCA should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abuamed in patients with a risk of an antibody induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration recommended in maintenance therapy should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit, which is due to the administration of epoetin, if the haemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required for the control of the anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not dialysis-based, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients under chemotherapy, epoetin alfa has to be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients that need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dose adaptation with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoieine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are provided for a larger electrical orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be investigated prior to the onset of epoetin alfa treatment.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing extensive elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular disease, particularly in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it is not possible to exclude that in treating epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can persist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia, or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was strived</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, pulmonary thrombosis, arterial thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, neurysms, retinthrombosis, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoids.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="581">Aclasta can not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, infusion and osteonecrose (die-off of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information material to physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit issued by Novartis Europharm Limited for the placing of Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in women with postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After the treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50.000 to 125.000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal function disorder (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypocemia should be treated with intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypocemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental implants, no data is available, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of cases reported as severe side effects of atrial fibrillation was increased in patients who received Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledron is associated with kidney dysfunction, which was associated as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The variation of the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis for more than three years between the clasta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine in 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patients "hombus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on preventing clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently littled hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local responses to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been regularly reported, especially in cancer patients, over osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in the jaw area with a patient with Aclasta and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypocemia, a compensation can be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="621">The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years for postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 to 89 years) were measured with either a bone density value (BMD) -T score for the femal dog ≤ -1,5 with or without signs of an existing spine fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fluid fractures Aclasta were significantly reduced over a period of three years, and after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over three years resulting in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the lumbar spine of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip decreased by 6.0%, the neck-neck by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In the case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic crest.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased compared to placebo treatment by the BMD on the overall pencils and thighs at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to the placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% in the overall penal and 4.3% on the neck-neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308 study), compared to the weekly administration of alendronate, the once-weekly administration of Alendronat was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget des Knochens Aclasta has been examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mostly light to moderately heavy-eyed paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared with the baseline for Aclasta and Risedron after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (addressed to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the patients who participated in the follow-up study of 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronate, the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with Risedronate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma was rapidly reduced to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ and 1.87 hours followed by a long elixiation phase with a terminal elimination-dural period t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early dividing phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned ½ -values) presumably represent rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours you will find 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearing of metabolised substances by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because Zoledron's acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only contains limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal active intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg of body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application the renal tolerance of zoledroneic acid in rats was measured by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose, corresponding to 7times of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC,).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the Gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an attack that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages starting from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and those of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of degraded serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron is a representative of a class called bisphosphonate, and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and bone Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of hormones, especially estrogens made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the hombus Paget the bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta acts by normalising bone reconstruction again, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation, giving the bone another strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or need to undergo dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines Please inform your doctor, chemist or nursing staff if you use other medicines or have been taken / used recently, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they are damaging the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta works for a long time, you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acetylcemia, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in triplegia was investigated; patients received a combination of Metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either acetylene or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar values were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplet study, the effect of an additional administration of acetylene and sulfonyl resin was reduced by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study evaluating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high concentration levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that, as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin, Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available to use Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcomes study with Pioglitazon in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other symptoms of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach problems, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should continue until the laboratory parameters are preceded by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be accumulated by fatty deposits and in some cases connected to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, slight reduction of mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity there is a risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia in patients receiving pioglitazone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as a two-fold combination therapy.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, diabetic macular edema, including pioglitazone, was reported or worsened in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events, fractures occurred with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a female wishes a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulin-insulaemia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the changor and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT-Antigege also frequently performed as under placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo, when Pioglitazone or Pioglitazon was reported.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7.400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative mediocation.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years in the ProActive study, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occured.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It was shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclasic as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Glicazidi).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was adequately adjusted with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics in a small group of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as marginal, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total blood matrix glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclasic and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison with placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazone, whereas values decreased under Metformin and Gliclasic.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks pioglitazon not only reduced the triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial hypertriglyceride levels, both in terms of triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcomes study, 552 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups that received either pioglitazon or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the top concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone in the plasma usually are reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been demonstrated that pioglitazone does not affect pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The middle plasma-elimination period of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys matched the plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulin-insulaemia resulting in the gestation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (with male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolites led to an increased frequency of colontumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events, fractures occurred with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with Pioglitazone or Gliclasic respectively.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial hypertriglyceride levels, this both in effect on tryglyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target with regard to their primary endpoint, which resulted in a combination of the total mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, coronary arrearisation and revitularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with the intake of Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c mirror suggesting that blood glucose levels were significantly lowered as compared to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of acetane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the full list of the package contents).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Human Use Committee (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of acetane in the treatment of diabetes were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the placing of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding starch, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA vs. insulin of animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Actrophane, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin, reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction (Alendronat 3.2% vs Plazebo 6.2%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of spine and trochanters continued to increase; also, the BMD of the femur neck and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies, in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of Alendronat reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebral fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% vs Plazebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of Alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after nightly fasting and two hours prior to commencing a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, Alendronat was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not result in clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Alendronate temporarily distributes itself after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-alendronate approximately 50% of radioactively marked substance was excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the faxes.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10mg, the renal clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronate is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs by means of these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies have shown that the portion of alendronate, which is not deposited in the bone, is excreted quickly over the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although there are no clinical data available, it is still to be expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, a slightly increased cumulation of alendronate in the bone can be expected in patients with reduced kidney function (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should be performed only under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formula, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advanKit should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases and on blood mirror regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraph, the Tacrolimus valley mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switch-over.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4 the systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a low-clearing substance, an adjustment of the stocking can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adaptations can be required later, as the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral advocate therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be performed twice daily dosage of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advance. this switch has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressive drugs to advanagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplant should start for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to Advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients although there is no clinical experience with an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, transplanted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with colorectal transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with limited renal function Since the renal function has no effect on the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatine absorption and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, be careful (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases by means of full blood Tacrolimus-Talula controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-blood-level mirrors of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adaptation, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time using substances which could change the tacrolimus thoroughbred concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments can take several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the sebaceous levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood stem from 5 - 20 ng / ml in the first time after liver transplantation - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should be performed only under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraph are still available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus's blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be avoided during a treatment with advance law (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolius concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a chamber or septum hypertrophy designated as cardiomyopathy was to be observed, which can therefore occur under advanayopathy.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders include an already existing heart condition, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should show a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances which can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole, as well as with the Macroeyelid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High dosed prednisolon or methylprednisolone, as is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contractions and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that Tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not provide any indication that, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Because of its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be conveyed by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the accumulation of the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent imitation of signal transductions in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocyte genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the T cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patient transplantation patients, in 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplantation and used in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as a primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral programs in these published studies reported the observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients to primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung Transplantation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted, multicenter trial with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis's obliteral syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the tacrolium and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, there were in 21.7% of the cases for the development of bronchiolitis of obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly higher (p = 0.02) than the number of patients transferred from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Topacic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplant rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of a bronchiolitis's obliterate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicentre study with oral program was performed on 205 patients receiving pancreatic and renal transplantation based on a randomised trial of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml of the 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years under Tacrolimus and Prednisone.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to talent levels between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacrolimus, or a reinforcement of the metabolism induced by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion mainly done via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than in Prograf in stable patients treated by Prograf (once daily) at 1: 1 (mg: mg) ratio to the full day dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent hemorrhages in patients with haemophilia A (a due to lack of factor VIII, congenital blood coagulation disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent hemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from a human plasma but is produced according to a method referred to as recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which makes it capable of forming the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding was evaluated in 86% of 510 new blood sepisodes with "excellent" resp. "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulant Factor VIII, mausoleum or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for placing lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following heretical events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients less than 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, appropriate determination of the Factor VIII-plasmasping is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and show different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directional IgG immunoglobulins that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is largest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In the case of previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which occur in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the coagulation factor VIII-mirror occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood coagulation was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, no 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) had a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophile granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As for other intravenous products ADVATE reported hypersensitivity reactions from the allergic type, including anaphylaktic / anaphylaktoid reactions (frequency unknown).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorisation, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially granted the CHMP) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to withdraw its application for the transfer of Adventiin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocate could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who joined Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be established in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programmes with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing drug release" means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In view of all the locuff symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took aerinaze reported about a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients with aerinaze showed a reduction in symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who alone received desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), oral drying, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">In patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active ingredients or lauatadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies), do not apply.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidosis (hypertension caused by cerebral thrombosis) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerinaze on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without shredding, breaking up or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms die.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, because with long-term use, the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued if necessary with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lisurid, cabergolin, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or of palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is deprecated at least 48 hours before the performance of dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical trials with desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, there were no significant differences between the patients treated with lorranadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was either alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate is an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a presumption that can lead to impairment of traffic efficiency or the capacity to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible portals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, vertigo, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth drying, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules' P-selection to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desolatadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of somnolence compared to placebo was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can induce other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal allergic rhinitis, where 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined by the total live scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine after the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the diminishing effect, determined by nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perortic application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine angiogenic was equivalent to exposure after administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadin, however, do not show any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle aches, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of conspicuous liver disease has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 Mg- lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 Mg- and 5 mg-melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml. of syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by investigating the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body evaluates the syrup, the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application with children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius increased by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both trials in Urticaria, the decline of the symptom score after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aperius may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current course of disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During the persistent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), a continuous treatment can be recommended for the patients during the allergic period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while consuming aperius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to headedness, which can lead to impairment of traffic efficiency or the capacity to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg, compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescents from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg of Desolatadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules' P-selection to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis aperius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Allergic rhinitis will be defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis will be defined as the appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was substituted for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine is a causative factor in all urticaria diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronically idiopathic urticaria, other forms of urticaria will lead to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations provided by the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the rate of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient's biographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had reached a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant grief after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a medium nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin at a comparable degree of exposure to loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadin do not show any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aperius can be taken independently of meals, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescriber doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with eerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and related laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolized to desloratadin and experience a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that can be metabolised is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The proliferation of this restricted metabolic phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which can be metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The strain (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company rejects its application for Aflunov's application for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is supposed to protect against a strain of the flu virus causing a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human, because humans do not yet have an immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as a "alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster when it comes to contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA Guidelines for Prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to take in, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asterase should only be decreed if the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus will be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of apregeneration depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of infections and diseases connected with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The low dosed Ritonavir amplified drug Agenerase was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to use protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but only very few responded to treatment by the children who used to be treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who used to be treated with protease inhibitors, this drug, with Ritonavir, lowered viral load after 16-week treatment as much as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it was possible to decrease the viral load after four weeks after four weeks as with the patients who took their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to Amblaavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are degraded as well as asgenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), an osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of aging in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweighed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic reinforcer Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing asgenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be administered for the pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amblaavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than by Amblaavir as a capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable for taking on a milligram per milligram base (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules amounts to 600 mg of Amprenavir twice a day along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amblaavir / kg bodyweight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amblaavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aziase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase Capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disturbance should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 isotherms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amblaavir while taking Amblaavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with aziase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppressing the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of awe with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available for determining the active substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to reduced plasma gas of Amblaavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amblaavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to evaluate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amprenavir, patients should be monitored on opipiate symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be dropped to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were required to provide medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer anti-retroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemothrosis are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defects, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual dual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time when an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial eology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given together with medicines, whose active agents are primarily metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amblaavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient already takes St. John's wort, the infivirus levels and, if possible, examine the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for one of the medicines is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with Amblaavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAX when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amblaavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amblaavir were twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreased when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The plasmin values of Amblaavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination of Amblaavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amblaavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amblaavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, but due to the fantasy component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenue of didanosin and agave lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore the dose of Efavirenz in combination with Amblaavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) does not require any dose adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amblaavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of Amblaavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amblaavir and Ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous application of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asterase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily resulted in increasing the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma at 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69fold compared to the value observed once daily without the simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below include substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4 inductors, if they are used together with Agenerase, possibly to interact.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions related to these drugs if they are used in combination with asterase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase, as it may cause resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Amblaavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Nifedipine, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism associated with PDE5 inhibitors (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days at test persons, the fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time as Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amblaavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time as amateavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be used together with orally taken midazolam (see Section 4.3) while caution is advised with parenteral midazolam while applying agrotase.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opipiate symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, such as the Amblaavir- dose can be adjusted if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous addition of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agrotase, stronger control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so also alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as agitasis (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, Amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether Amblaavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by inhalation in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amblaavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase Treatment were mild to moderate, and were early on and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or any other medicines applied to the HIV treatment at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors receive 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were assessed by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and occurred with more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals who had been treated with Amblaavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study of PROF3006, 245 NRTIs compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) were found in 241 patients under Incaravir, in combination with various NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amblaavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defects, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual dual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dosed Ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception formed increases in the triglyceride and CPK values, which received alase along with low dosed Ritonavir very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosage, the patient is observed on signs of an intoxiation (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amblaavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinformation stages with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both acutely and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amblaavir against HIV-1 in vitro and inhibiting HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosing regimens - as with other ritonavir gebooed regimens with protease inhibitors - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-cured patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of 13 out of 14 children, where virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those found in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T, I50V, A71V, V77I, I85V, I85V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamblown avir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107), patients with virus failure occurred over 96 weeks following the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Results based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I62V, V82A / C / F / F, I62V, V82A / C / F / F, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to assess the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to Ampriavir creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amblaavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistence paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviruses non-treated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (one of 25 insulates), Darinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), Saquinavir (three out of 24 insulates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 insulates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amblaavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibiting insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a seeding therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study conducted with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside halga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-nine (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-understatement threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of untreated atherase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, 152 of whom were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed Ritonavir was given simultaneously; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of" "" "unbleed" "" "asgenerase should be taken into account in the optimisation of treatment with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAX, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amblaavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amblaavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg of a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Amblaavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Amblaavir, which represents the active part, will probably remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of non-bonded amateavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the overall dosage concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily routine diagnosis as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules, hence Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a kidney dysfunction is likely to be minor on the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Amblaavir plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were used in male animals in doses of 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily injection of 1200 mg of Amblaavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, showed little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro toxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests, mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amblaavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be observed and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, either during the administration of Agenerase after the treatment was finished.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity with juveniles who were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">However, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes, which indicate delayed development, were observed in a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly lower (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules amounts to 20 mg of Amblaavir / kg bodyweight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amblaavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with a low or minor liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The plasmin values of Amblaavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination of Amblaavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amblaavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amblaavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amblaavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these medicines are used, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amblaavir and Ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Nifedipine, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days at test persons, the fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous addition of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agrotase, stronger control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethindrone) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amblaavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after replacing the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 lesions showed a less complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the release or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable level of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) cannot be quantifiable after a single or several topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-cream related adverse events in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the area of treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side-effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod-Cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial report are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-cream in relation to the side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This study, according to study plan, shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies, three-week treatment with Imiquimod-Cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / off-blade (23%) and edema (14%) and edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This study, according to study plan, shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-Cream is very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring and scarring (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The occasional unique oral recording of 200 mg. of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia, and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was significantly superior regarding a complete recovery of the genital warts in an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients in total with Imiquimod treated patients, the patients were completely cured; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% from 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod for five-day use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficially cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod for three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non hypertrophic ac- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the hairless scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical radiotherapy after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external fenustains, actinic keratose and superficially cell carcinoma do not generally occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials against children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of pharmaceutical drugs at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2hours half-life time after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on TMC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years, comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for the dermal application for four months showed no similar effects on the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice received no tumours in the application for three days a week.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for the human being to view as very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the drug-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2256">Breastfeeding your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream is not known as it is not known whether Imiquimod passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in cases of biases, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the skin warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully drawn.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme substitute therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with recovery equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining the effect of reducing the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion location.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe BV a permit for the placing of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme substitute therapy in patients with advanced diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect arising during the infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting where revitational equipment for medical emergencies is immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that virtually all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery after a longer period of interruption, the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautiously preceded by an interruption of treatment due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretika) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or reduction of infusion rates to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there are no data on newborns exposed to Laronidase over the mother's milk, it is recommended that the treatment with Aldurazyme is not breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily reported as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 trial and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing problems and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe trial and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated to a Seroconversion within 3 months after the treatment was started (after 26 days versus 45 days versus 45 days in patients at age 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature withdrawal from the study), there were no immunohistochemistry (RIP) assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients in which it was never released into Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a low to low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine whereas a variable reduction of GAG in urine was ascertained in patients with high antibody tiresins.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme substitute therapy lies in a sufficient recovery of enzyme activity for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely about mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function compared to the placebo arm, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In view of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected procentric normal FEV, range in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmacokinetic of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with severe waveform and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) showed a normal mental developmental speed after the Z score for this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of different durazyms dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that is available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin an "anti-emetic" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, taken off or the dose decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of fixed fixed slows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetremixed into its active form is easier to place in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer period of life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study on 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time of Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta took longer survival compared to the comparison drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. an approval for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each glass bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dos- sis is taken from the ep-through bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant tissue epithelial hiology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loor, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominating plate epithelial hiology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of surface area (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetremixed dose and after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetreboxed, a complete blood picture should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartame transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under the recovery of the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the preceding therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applied to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop ill-haematological toxicity ≥ C3 (except neurotoxicity), therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio- or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 or so- fort scale 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 and above, compared to patients aged 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper biliruby limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-times of the upper limit (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients have to be monitored with regard to bone sarcisation and Pemetreboxed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet cell count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutralization, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and nicotic toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (kreatinin-clearing 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetreboxed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients designated for therapy with fixed fixed need to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetreboxed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure, or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant liquid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion is to be considered before the pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events have been reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed occasionally if this ingredient is usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated living vaccines (except yellow fever, this inoculation is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Given the possibility of irreversible foaming of reproductive capacity by Pemetreboxed, men should be advised against the treatment - Ginn to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced pemetremixed secretion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetreboxed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous application with Pemetreboxed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There is no data for the use of pemetreboxed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Fixed fixed may not be used during pregnancy, unless it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Given the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetreboxed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetremixed - as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetreboxed) is an antineoplastic anti-folate that performs its effect by interrupting wich- and follicant metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetremixed acts as an antihiat with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylynthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycine-dribbonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate key enzymes of de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and purlins.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin for chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month prolonged survival compared to those with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60mg show an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional fluctuations in pregnancy to prevent the potential failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma gas was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normal ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene in the normal range remained.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplemental vitamin supplement prior to bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin uptake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the administration of a one-off dose of amiodarone, a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side-effects reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to convulsions with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat were reported.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid re-formation of any systemic effects caused by the inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding of the active Serine-Rest of the gastran and pankreatical lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypokalical, fatty-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was assessed as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a proportion of those participating in study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both trials, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average total in Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be demonstrated sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of an accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systemic absorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1, after splitting the N-Formyl leucine Group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2572">If you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat, risk associated accompanying symptoms (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to the new eating habits, start with a calorie and fat-reduced diet prior to the first capsule intake.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Food diaries are effective, as you can easily understand what you eat, how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">In order to safely reach your target weight, you should specify two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you will notice side effects not specified in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment begins, as at this time you might have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional side effects: • Beginner already a few days, or better one week, before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of you exceeding your fat limit is decreasing. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloha is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloha can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic agent).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloha was studied at 1,842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate triggering for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with alopxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with alopxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189) in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for the marketing of alohxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloha is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer illness and to prevent nausea and vomiting with medically etogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alohxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestical obstipation or signs of a subacute ischemia should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with the simultaneous offering of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with whom the QT interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloha should not be used to prevent nor treat nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five investigated chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous Palonosetron dose and a ferrite-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous offering of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (acetametidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, Ritonavir, Sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of using palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mcg (a total of 633 patients), which at least probably were associated with alohxi (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar abundances of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective in treating an overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies 1,132 patients who received a medically etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-life: 7.3 hours) were given to day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blind study a total of 667 patients receiving a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with medically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of bentosetron administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionately in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was between day 1 and day 5 at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in 3 consecutive days was comparable with the one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injektion in healthy eyes, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disturb the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron, a reduction in dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered to be sufficiently close to the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, indications pointed out that palonosetron can only block Ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose in about the 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloha is determined for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the announcement of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same veteran ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage causes damage, and the values of the liver enzyme of Alanine Amino ferase (ALT) are standard in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The Alpheon company presented data confirming the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the effectiveness of the reference resin.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no sign of the virus detected in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int: / / www.emea.eu.int: / / www.emea.eu.int: / / www.emea.eu.int: / / www.emea.eu.int.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Further concerns were expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease brightened again with more patients than in the case of the reference veterinary. Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the investigational test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug contains an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of bepetigo (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infected infirmaries (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarma may not work against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin area to be treated must not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients with placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwine, about 90% of patients in both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been noted that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (breast-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the ordering site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were predominant in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmaries, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd a permit for the market launch of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitizing or serious local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been reached in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the middle Retapamulin EC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether breastfeeding will continue or the treatment with Altargo should be continued or terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied Altargo, the most frequently reported side-effect irritation at the meeting place, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interaction and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosome subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some types of infection appears questionable, advice should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin towards S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 separated skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retina IC IC50 for PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptivity liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mice lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats microcores for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dosage of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skimplanted skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development of development (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed ossification) and maternal toxicity were established.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between the ages of one and fifteen years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be brought to an end by two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by assisting the immune system (the body's natural defense) as it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components as the vaccination vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccination approved by Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination schedule.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix abstain from identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in six months and at a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission issued the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan for the basic dimming with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who responded to hepatitis C vaccination would need a booster vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected from immunological memory with no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, insufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels may not be reached after priming, so that additional doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact failure in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may, as an exception, be injected subcutaneously, as in these cases intramuscular administration may lead to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measles mumps-rocking vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this wording in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matedness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thickage and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants ranging from 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and toxicity on a calculation basis per Vaccine Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50,7% of subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the participants who had given Ambience had pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matching was comparable to pro-volume (i.e. over the entire vaccine rate at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matedness was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambitious group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, serum rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinationofcombinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was expandable, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared with Ambirix for hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both trials, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated HepatitisA A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study from 12- to including 15-year-olds it was demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies 24 months after immunization in the 0-6- month vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year at the same time was administered with the booster of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps, the immune response was adequate to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotective and seroconversion rates for the current formulation as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resorption of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>
<seg id="2773">According to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state-of-the-art batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface agent).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia - divided among several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via Gastrostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach's leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>

<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme shortage already manifests itself in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">In patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyl nitrate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate on young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neural multiplication and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one undesirable event (AE) occurred in 56% of the patients and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an anorectal patient who had a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate acidosis, severe hypocemia, armortopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of an overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an unintentional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of taken sodium phenylbutyl rate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with occurence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease itself caused even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitric secretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutylate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is encapsulated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyl rate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied for cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies, phenylacetate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) could not be detected in the plasma following different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the median acetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus, sodium phenylbutyl nitrate was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (babies and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a Gastrostomia or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyl rate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-turtles were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions in the pyramid-cells of the brain-bark occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an anorectal patient who had a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate acidosis, severe hypocemia, armortopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Biometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylmonyl glutamine in patients with malfunctioning of the urea cycle, it is assumed that sodium phenylacetylacetyrat is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly even in treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyl rate in granular form 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can save the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of up to 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other drugs or have taken a short time, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding you should not take AMMONAPS, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, stopping the hearing, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), such as instable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an abnormal measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in the sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI they often used a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent a closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - was just as effective in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revitularization) after 30 days or one year as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalidine, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd a permit for placing angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency interventions or when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous intake of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">In the case of a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous intake of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration of angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to decrease the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the intake dose is rapidly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function limitation (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalidine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bivalirudin-Bolus was administered without dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 It is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in patients with dialysis (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivaliddin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivaliddin is restored to the level existing before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or Thrombocyte units), it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalidine with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are insufficient regarding the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivaliddin alone, 4604 were randomized to bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or etoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivaliddin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both to the catalytic center and to the anion bond region of thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is present in the liquid phase or on clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and thereby its effect, is reversible because Thrombin itself is slowly splitting the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, a thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) could induce a thrombocyte aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients bivaliddin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is covered by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed following a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalidin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor prior to the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly over the three treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and one-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for the patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY major bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular hemorrhage or hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalidine as Peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reconversion of amino acids in the body swimming pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombine is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not show any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10-fold of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) restricted to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects due to a longer-term physiological strain as a reaction to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Unless the production of ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, this is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose containers made from type 1 glass to 10 ml, which sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are placed in a bottle of angiox and are slightly swivelled until everything has dissolved completely and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml in order to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose level (sugar) in the blood or which cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin ulisin differs very slightly from insulin analog, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of time than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to handle insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined by 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%).</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration amounted to 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisines or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the upper leg or the delta muscle or subcutaneously through continuous infusion into the abdominal area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (producer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of manufacture can result in a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from one patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin-used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopypyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxylic acid, salicylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, Guanethidin and reserves, the symptoms of the adrenergic counterparty regulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin discharge occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are sorted according to system class categories and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, headedness, excessive dog-ger, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Opens to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by a trained person or treated by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous ga- be of insulin ulisin the action occurs faster and the operation time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin ulisin showed a proportionate glucosal effect in the therapeutically relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin ulisin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that an application of insulin ulisin 2 minutes before the meal achieves a comparable postpranic glycaemic control as given with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin ulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin ulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- oves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin ulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin ulisin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
