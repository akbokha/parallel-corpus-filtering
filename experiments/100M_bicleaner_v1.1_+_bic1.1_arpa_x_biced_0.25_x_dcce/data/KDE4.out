the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
for more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that perhaps more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Canc@@ el . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the Posi@@ tive filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras views filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : DVI element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you can see .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling options .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over color mode , can either display depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying , or if the area is used by lower rec@@ tan@@ gles . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps display algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always observed . it is drawn frames to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need space , which is then lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
how dividing the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by frame always advantageous to divide the areas so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you call the module image gallery , a dialog opens which allows you to specify the appearance of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option image per line has a slider and a rotation box to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames will be displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails under the thumb@@ nails .
with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the File Sel@@ ection in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box in the sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a rotation range until at which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images with the original images to copy the original images to the gallery .
with the commentary file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ ve color depth , you can set a different color depth for thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the F@@ 9 key short@@ cut .
to play , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add the browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
change the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to access the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam , albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works entirely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains one entry problems or wishes ... This opens a dialog with a signed connection . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means that the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , you may have questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , you may soon be speaking English , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ kam , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . simply enter path names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data output is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use you as an Al@@ ben@@ copy .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; Dur@@ ing recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by adding a dot in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Sub@@ mit to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ kam ; perhaps also circum@@ vent@@ ing it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ m settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam , albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the digi@@ k@@ am preview images can be read out reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , you might be unable to see thumb@@ nails or production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ kam , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam , even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures everywhere : you can cast a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ m , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to undo the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment . thus , the filter on the file name only works if it is shown in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed can be configured in the Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ Li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos , edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ ported Images scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to highlight your albums so you can group together under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos by selecting items from the tool@@ bar or collection items . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : will be used when you sort your albums after date by viewing albums by date .
the buttons Ol@@ dest , average , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you probably want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a while while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu for all thumb@@ nails .
information about each image is displayed below the preview . what information is this , you can change the settings digi@@ kam ; set up . select here the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you want to let the mouse cursor enter a moment over a picture , the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such an auxiliary window .
images and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to it . you can reach all the features that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by right @-@ clicking either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit ... .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the File menu . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing other image processing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data with you when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for shooting . the easiest is to right @-@ click on the preview and select Tur@@ ning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click on preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My date sli@@ de@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported at the loss of the database as soon as it is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword , this will become the under@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword , clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to insert the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
in order to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
it can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keywords .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have edited a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the thumb@@ nail of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will only show you the keywords assigned to the photo .
the time beam view displays a tim@@ el@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
near the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds hit . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above . you can also save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just need to select the corresponding entry from View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit searches , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for the search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ copy . all rules are listed in line by operators . any option can be added to this list with Search Group / Search Group . each option can be associated with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... You can also search for the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes any picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ist , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : hands @-@ free sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ Program . you can drag it or zoom out or hold it . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ file .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , even raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ tening table from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection is added to the light@@ box and its window opens . if you are back in the menu , you can quickly open the illumin@@ ator with L Extras lamp .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place them there . a small arrow tells you what copy in which window area can be seen .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you use pair @-@ mode navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the sections for the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the illumin@@ ating table , e.g. F@@ 4 File Edit ...
all image information from the right side panel of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated area . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the Mode preview , both images will show the same image area .
just use the zoom control below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are previ@@ ew@@ ing the zoom mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , evaluate , sn@@ u@@ g , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management adop@@ ts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no longer to find a specific photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use it not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access them with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be on your computer . you need to decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend storing metadata in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? &amp; digi@@ kam ; it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you now need to assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work .
let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or place the images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be done simply by pulling a sub @-@ tree on another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to share your photos with anyone , you want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you that this is the landing field of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream of having associations , memories , the historical time span is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who regard your photos , the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you want to show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him over the motif that has moved you to understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even ex@@ its you a spell chec@@ ker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights in order to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the Direc@@ tion Page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or semi @-@ col@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you can see the picture on others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is shown here .
the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pros this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years . whether you believe it lies in your discretion .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu @-@ ray discs .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . please read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark , dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disc@@ ard manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives available on this topic : disc@@ ard study
soon : Dis@@ ks last the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate increases dramatically with lower temperatures . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect this error . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT termin@@ ate the immediate im@@ pending failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make much power , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy slots and provides the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector line . remember , however , that not every connector line also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system should also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage bum@@ pers , which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV board .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks , and are therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to work even further until the current is running again . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end , you should always remember how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures to have full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its own fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that use the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss at the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . at not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the@@ fts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so back up your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the sharing of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you take your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then , one day , a lightning strike you are lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ fts are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore des@@ ast@@ er@@ bow@@ bow@@ bow@@ ing always means not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ assess while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than to for@@ wards a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but do not app@@ end it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . this task is made from year to year easier .
GIF is a proprietary patented format which slowly disappears from the market . it should therefore not be used anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard GIF must replace . however , it can store much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now making use of D@@ NG and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon can use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &apos; resource block quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to file their data in a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; that stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format will fail . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera are edited , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in web galleries , code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ copy .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when the connection is made , a ready @-@ to @-@ use indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the images were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected selected button is di@@ gest@@ ed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new images have been marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you use the buttons all download or download selected items , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed , like normal folders , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete them at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only a few , you have to select it first and then delete the selected deleted .
note that there is no way to restore photos you deleted from the camera . you should check carefully if the photos have been downloaded into a digi@@ kam ; so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos from different recording studios to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for database @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the standard auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % % H : % M : % S in the edit box . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic spin during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Met@@ adata page you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this is used to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case saved &amp; digi@@ kam , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub@@ section at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know where to upload the images . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position that can be displayed in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to indicate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ or ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the posi@@ tional data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with a ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com doesn &apos;t show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to access these settings , you must select in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be previ@@ ew@@ ed or edited on Embedded Pre@@ view . in this way , you set the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected while downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be labels such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this ensures that metadata is permanently stored in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam , but this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without any loss .
save image descriptions as embedded tags ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this means that your cap@@ tions can also be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Ref@@ resh button to the right of each category .
the settings of the light@@ box of &amp; digi@@ kam , can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the illuminated button , these settings are not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when using the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF files option , you can switch the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor respond to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference produces a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images receive more details in four steps in more detail . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is it the pointed lights , so the parts of your images which are burned in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as penet@@ rating white . use the setting colors to trigger certain unusual results , as it shows the pointed lights in various ros@@ at@@ ars . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ ters .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ constructing option , you get the option to set a level . here a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to minimize the time for the demo , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo invo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ breaking design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ m provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ in Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding , as it is performed during the raw conversion process .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions such as these should be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space to translate into the other is that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior If a picture is opened in the image processing / color @-@ management module with raw file starts .
color profile folder Use here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard source ; to store for your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given by one device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not for Canon models . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then deleted by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features show on the left hand a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Auto recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in picture display mode . underneath are the serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass stores .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch it on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be implic@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display &amp; digi@@ kam the welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
setting Start after new photos forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam , to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings using the Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . you will find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , showing the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and underneath the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this using File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore or button The Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last time it was saved .
almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can undo the last action by undo / restore undo by selecting re@@ producing from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Turn @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click the Return or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword , by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ larger Automati@@ cally
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can view it from the Edit Pan@@ e window .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or entire phrases . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Wi@@ zard from the menu album Export Wi@@ zard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it will be displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click , because the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button more . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the rating from the tool@@ bar is applied to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always applied only to one image . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field of the ur@@ gency . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter keywords , keywords , and a box with the keywords mentioned before in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ Session glos@@ sary .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this feature is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and you choose a keyword in the keywords tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to specify a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword @-@ filter section .
the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search @-@ views . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right @-@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off under Settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created it and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1@@ GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly bought it &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish in the web that correspond to your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you can make informed decisions at every point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make sure that you have more information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another colour space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then information About RGB working spaces .
do I need to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to connect to your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space from s@@ RGB , you either have to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , S@@ ame , Automatic Comp@@ are and Con@@ trast wi@@ den from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction menu try to make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects in order to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alizes : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity values over the whole picture , making the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade .
balance : this method uses the intensity channel of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same number of brightness results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it only produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because you can use a colour space with 8 bits per color . so if you are too far from the original picture you can perform over@@ exposure . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the target picture . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the destination image preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
at the top right there is a hist@@ ogra@@ m showing that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit pictures that most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your score depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow Adju@@ st@@ ment lets you improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos .
to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make it exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
the default settings return all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as those for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour @-@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . you can consult a detailed color management guide for the use of color profiles .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for more than one photo . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under Col@@ dation Gra@@ dation in the menu .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Tool Far@@ ming effects provides you with four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ is , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when a partly developed pressure was exposed to a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image was completed . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ is . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally generates a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ is effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ a@@ ot &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment to experiment the different colour aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . even in this case , the brightness / satur@@ ation tool is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ew@@ ed . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog appears very complicated for this tool , you only need the area of the slide . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the regulator and watch how the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ ks can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . additionally , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ ading image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and load it later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the hist@@ ogra@@ m &apos;s input for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ all Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all the color channels in order to find over @-@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . in this case , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a c@@ rank@@ case to the right , i.e. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker .
on previ@@ ew@@ ing the original photos a red marker is visible . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you select this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ all Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all the color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel bl@@ ender ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color nu@@ ances of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the image preview has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz , the picture will retain the overall brightness even if you also activate the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green @-@ channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
stores as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ all Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all the color channels in order to find over @-@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz store is activated . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / White photography has always been fascinating about your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color adjustment and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit col@@ dness to the mold tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . in detail , the picture rounds with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce rounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will have greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the image , the greater the character set needs to be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template apply you can put a template over a picture .
the Picture Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; template database , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
res@@ ized : this button res@@ ized the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image is then adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools to focus . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
shar@@ per mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process has to be merged with only minimal differences to a single color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed when dy@@ es are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures a camera has often been applied in internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers already apply a sharpen@@ er while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the focus .
you should be careful however , as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing the tool . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ eren . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the plasti@@ ci@@ zed menu and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the shar@@ per mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are created near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore sharp@@ ens images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . this sets the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surfaces avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus mostly reaches better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular focus : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very poor .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is G@@ auss . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular focus or the palate . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Up@@ load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any more re@@ focused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the cutting , color and intensity correction on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before modi@@ fying the picture in any other way . the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible , but leave behind unpleasant arti@@ facts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king uses a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Wiener Fil@@ ters it is possible to show that it is the optimum lens filter . in practice , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour that needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob smoo@@ thes the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows for a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most sophisticated tool for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the picture . weighed against larger values mainly homogeneous regions and make details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
strai@@ gh@@ tening Indi@@ c@@ ence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value is smoo@@ thed in 1 direction only . if you have a movie or CCD is a high value wa@@ ving wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ b@@ aric effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ incre@@ ments since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is only minor , but it doubles the duration . therefore , we recommend it to leave it out .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make it exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved to a text file and then loaded again .
correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected using small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera . as you can see there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is to be seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is elevated , rou@@ gh@@ ness peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image data can no longer be preserved and noise or gre@@ ases occur again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it is not possible to remove the entire noise or smoke tip . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without loos@@ ing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more severely smo@@ thered , but it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high can a s@@ me@@ ar occur .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the plasti@@ ci@@ zed menu and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local faults that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then loaded again .
photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ End button .
below you can restore like a photo with uni@@ formity r@@ ushing .. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) to see .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo , which was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
this &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixels of photos that have been kept with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression will feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel rate ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel rate ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual way to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark@@ ening . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the fitting dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard notices the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : an average of neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise the sharp@@ ness effects are caused by motion .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s filtering and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of shock absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ escence and contrast correction is also performed in the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the second degree coefficient covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners towards that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . negative values can be corrected ton@@ ed distor@@ tions and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted hall@@ mark of the parameter general .
zoom : this value re @-@ sc@@ aled the image size and thus correc@@ ts the first grade . negative values increase while positive image resi@@ sts .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog tells a preview of distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the tone or cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ed correction , the effect would be apparent to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse cursor over the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform@@ ieren Rand@@ om editing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from front , frames and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is to be seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters setting film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option joining film gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photographs , as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film @-@ grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers are mixing large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ely from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film &apos;s effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images . smoo@@ thes controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the arti@@ fic@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and fl@@ atten 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ish landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the Be@@ End button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ per : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels by a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a spinning camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
blur@@ ring of motion : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal moti@@ ons of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : photograph taken from a car or train , camera .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by means of random shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the colour pool in the picture and blur@@ ring them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the picture into rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the Be@@ End button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops to your picture . thus , it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the Select tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops of the filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming C@@ ats menu .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you restore or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Edit Quanti@@ ty in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm image bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
retained aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . it can be used as text file and can be re@@ charged later .
photo B@@ aking is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ End button .
you can see an example for photo bubbles below by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . image processing allows this very easy . to cut a photo you simply need to use the mouse only the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and moving the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly aid make it possible to da@@ zzle aid so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal of achieving good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition results in the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric flow on this type .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye direc@@ ts in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be placed a static object dynam@@ ischer .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horiz@@ ontal View and Ver@@ tical options can be used to reflect the harmonic expan@@ sions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing and the tool free rotation . select transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right of the window .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Trans@@ former cutting from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Automati@@ cally Zu@@ mming . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after shooting . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing .
the sc@@ aling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m .
rotate your image by using horizontal and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sha@@ kes produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to crop the image with transform cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done by the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will change . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; see the configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw picture format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw Image Converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section , you can find further information about the use of Mod@@ ular modules .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in capabilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start playback .

many tools you need to make photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description will follow .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , noise reduction , re@@ focus , sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture Application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left panel shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview range .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower part compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ Program . you can drag it or zoom out or hold it . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files installed by &amp; k@@ de can either apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse folders for files .
the cursor is shown in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described in the Pal@@ ettes view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is activated by the Add Color button , the color is inserted from the color chart on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the over@@ writing check box under the cursor cursor .
a selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section , can be used together with the Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a poin@@ ter character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color choos@@ er can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs included &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs with only a few functions .
the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; sound ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; multip@@ liers ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; posters ; re @-@ comp@@ utes the graph and represents in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in one &amp; c ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog File .
after selecting one or more of the dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the scroll wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
zoom in both directions is limited by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction in a graph .
if the currently loaded file was changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; can also remember your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings k@@ graphi@@ cally .
when you open a graph file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; instance , in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally viewer ; instance , or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph that come on one page should be matched to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .

the Recon@@ nect Page provides the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically upload or ignore the changes ) or leave the program any time .
the Open page gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can specify a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session administration page gives you the ability to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or determine to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; appears , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible edge overl@@ aps .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for graph@@ ene graph@@ ene . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene a spring@@ board model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circul@@ arly in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values of your own to select your image . look at the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have cli@@ cked the button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the image file appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files are created . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the im@@ porting &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas you should select this delay high enough to have the time to go there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialogue Options dialog appears with the options already described above .

if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in the size . the size is taken from the value of the maximum size .
maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio stays constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool for ex@@ porting your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alization allows to add and edit the GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the cel@@ esti@@ al coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above dialog appears . to allow a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data recorded at the same time in the same places as the images of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera space must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates a top deviation for the GPS time and camera position . if the deviation is below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ating and Differ@@ ent in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location lies in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box sees the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase it . always select the region in question until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the hex@@ id@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select those albums . the albums will not be displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ ign preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab look defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each picture a page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings , where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , it also affects file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client &apos;s K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then retrieve the Import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at hex@@ id@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ ter Module is a tool to convert a set of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , .@@ This module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the module using Extras m@@ peg slides .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow whenever you are back .
if an indicator appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings button at the bottom .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer .
first select the RAW file that is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same , and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later , you should not select the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata stored in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the option to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non proportional : non proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be shown with the images selected by you . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last selected image a preview will be displayed on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the Pictures button , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format Menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original I@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au will appear a window with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL output option in the presentation enables very elegant display operations using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the option file name display ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it using Es@@ c .
the option to select images by chance ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , any transition between the images chooses a different effect .
during the slideshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting up an image as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these browsers , see the picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , thus in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
if you click on the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
in order to display pictures beside the names , select the button located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image preview window ( in more detail ) and select the category editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the preview window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
if you call the Find item in the main window , a dialog appears to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog box again .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options at the bottom of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; sing photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo . you will then download some sample images and you can try the functions from &amp; photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as a connected HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you Dat@@ es statistics on the images in your database .
you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview pane from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select a range , you will only browse images of this time frame in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar in the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the File HTML menu ...
before HTML pages are created , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first enter the title of the moment and a description which the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ Photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ Ex@@ ample pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether to create a &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file to be viewed on the overview page . read more about export files in .
finally , you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , all images are from a party . note that all images are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this page is not dealt with specifically .
on the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this means those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer on your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , you set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , correctly works you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may of course want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you will have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and im@@ porting .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that you can pass this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file looks for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
at option Manual to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy the Automati@@ cally to the .@@ k@@ im file copy to copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most of the pictures were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... selecting , it will import &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the Im@@ ports Wi@@ zard consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of people of the im@@ porting file person@@ er ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the porting file to be imported , and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step you can check the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps taken from ( 1 ) Deter@@ mining the information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; notices the folder where your images are stored and uses them again for future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so if you want to start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; sing photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ Photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will see the different settings options .
to the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can access the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is provided that you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how to set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
view the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group at one time in a group rather than all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
in the list of options listed above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; share your module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; they are distributed separately , but most of the modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database can be viewed either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules to enable you to use the functions with &amp; sing photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , we also have to release a list of albums . here we go &amp; sing photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you are , for example , the category characters , will do &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you would have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setting dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you have a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . at the moment , you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people on the picture , where the image has been taken . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example , it is illustrated on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to reloc@@ ate the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures , you can , by doing so , move the names used upwards , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image separately , you may still want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons located at the top right of the image .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and use the menu item for multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window displaying the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that this is an over@@ group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry . note , this requires you to sort exactly your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and / or moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the pane .
when you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then close the window . you can see this procedure in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t set a filter . you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and select either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use them without having saved them on the hard drive . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so that you can record them in the database . in the picture you see the View from &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can view the preview of these images . you can , however , not view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and copy it back again . so far , if you want to avoid the insertion of the respective CD , please buy a larger disk to save all images .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make in@@ accessible and click Rec@@ ent View in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and unlock the menu entry Every@@ thing apart from the current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures to be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all the images on the hard drive and on the other hand , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason you spend all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason , it has &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and disc@@ ard elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ s@@ 1 and End . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom out , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key you can zoom in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the single @-@ key you set the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out using the plus and minus key .
with the Rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by putting the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture , where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have typ@@ ed features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add all of them at once with comments . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to work on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painting later .
in can you see a picture on which was painted . to switch on the Mal@@ mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; switch On the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire @-@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object .
in order to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the Edit menu bar , or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly , or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can invoke the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press a preview in the property view and a small example of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture will be rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , tick local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also save several window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below an existing view , drag the viewer to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the viewer to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to trigger a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the attack on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the front panel .
to close a view click on the small cross in the front panel . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
you can save the current window view with the window order ... save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be installed properly . as this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item Sc@@ ene Sc@@ ene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a fast preview to full @-@ screen images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View modes ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image cut@@ out for rendering to the input fields .
in the drop down sel@@ ector quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used to render . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixel is included . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split again and again , because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 jets per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually followed and further sub@@ divided . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the jet process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the item entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; does not yet contain the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when im@@ porting error messages or warnings occurs , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . please insert the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ tim@@ etry data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object type of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross high detail faithful to advanced projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a floor is rendered under the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when activating channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values . detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window instructions or create new window instructions . in the section window instructions , you will see how you can create and save window instructions .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing windows orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window instructions . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and select selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not anchored in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
when you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed all wrong settings , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and icons often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Pan@@ e item . now you have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry named camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later gu@@ id@@ ances , but note that the camera has control points to change the camera &apos;s target point . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the App@@ ly button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert End@@ liche body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; provides actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , even at the moment , only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizon , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose your first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = Ground @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter the pig@@ ments settings . please always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the Qu@@ ader and sphere preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then preview the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the object &apos;s view :
you should be able to do this step by step , as you should have already understood the basic mode of operation of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button App@@ den ) , that the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would ho@@ ver over the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now yields a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set a suitable material in the next step .
once you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color :
choose Er@@ stes sub@@ property and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on sphere pigment , then select one @-@ colored and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you want &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . thus the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that needs to be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last @-@ made command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit undo .
save the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set pres@@ et short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option tool@@ set for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient visual viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file type , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show dialog ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when closing the name of the recently opened folder . the next start will open &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the picture in the window mode , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed that can display the program as well .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decrease the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarge the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to reporting at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto , is to join the developer mailing list . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you will need to select the show@@ foto in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color displayed when the under@@ carriage or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . skill@@ ful , the colors should be contrasting with what you should display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of the show photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab :
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set to the command line of &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; with the command cann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed output options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if a preview is selected in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog in front of each scann@@ ed image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the Save button .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically @-@ saving images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; channels ; the knob Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit .

below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and select Global Shift . select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific short@@ cuts you can set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and select short commands ... Select .
you may set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this will make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist , and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function break might be :
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use a dialog for the user to know why a script is not running .
beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates directory , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events .
configure Know@@ s the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information on the new piece ( such as metadata or unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also delivered to allow the script to use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storage of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ka@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amar@@ ino@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
if you already have a few play@@ lists , you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music .
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , it has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled for some of the compile options so that they can be used . for details , see the System requirements section .
activating Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symb@@ ols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the m@@ ood@@ bar .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
place mood files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ config files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not listed in the list above .
when you exit the playlist , the current playlist will automatically save when you exit from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , you will use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the play@@ lists &quot; location , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
keeping up @-@ to @-@ date piece during a piece change@@ over causes the playlist window to appear / un@@ roll to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the appearance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting proprietary scripts you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the selected color sel@@ ector for foreground and background color .
restart at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point where it has been stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen Display sub @-@ window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if you want to use on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if individual colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , enabling you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further adjustments in this card map .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains cross Fiel@@ ds for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitoring changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l set section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : where the machine is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port where the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card win@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package node and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager is keeping the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by clicking ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file causing the crash .
mostly this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a info , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The $ AR@@ GV ( 0 &#93; ) ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2 tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing tags from $ AR@@ GA &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( access mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click on a symbol in the control centre under Ap@@ pear@@ ance icons . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ fying Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok Channel .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please insert a bug there if you do something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist .
this is simple . use the File Browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column view . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece . you can also use the short@@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . you can also find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 @-@ decoder are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 Vel@@ de , En@@ ter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you to find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also enco@@ des the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or simply install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs respond to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must record all components . follow @-@ register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder .
if you have an entire list of proposals / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title if you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running part : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable windows .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right button @-@ click puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the section of the control bar ?
click on the button of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console .

basically this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and Edit : select rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog .
developers don &apos;t want you to know when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means that K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term set of Amar@@ ok .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please get the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
you probably need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . you now have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set up Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output function . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . you may naturally take this issue yourself in your own hands ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed assistants for Arts : )

group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted by genre and then sorted by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .

the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the Play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :

beneath the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL . if you are typing tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : the dropping files are inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply entering the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search words separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you type in between the search terms OR , search entries are searched for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing whit@@ esp@@ ace , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : app@@ rais@@ al : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : - something searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you can find the Add to the playlist that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons track undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .

the New button re@@ stores the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist editing opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit . this opens the dialog to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist , however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be b@@ yp@@ assed and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while respecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played that are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this lets you easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts by clicking the script . it will open a selection dialog where a script package for installation can be selected . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet .
if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing section of Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window Visual Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start tells you how to create with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , remember that when encoding video you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project to do so .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; -@@ settings , please press the Start button . now you can see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoding module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them on an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mix@@ able CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are played differently according to .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and to automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and modification . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will prompt for any project that is not saved , just as if you had called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each project that is not saved , it will be asked what should happen , as if you had called a file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you have the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the resulting files appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , which causes the burning of the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of copy dialog is not yet supported , therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the whole ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which completely removes the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will ask for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black borders .
displays information about the medium presented . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Content View allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read out audio or video CDs , provided that a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area which is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks only pretty , and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the top section , you can adjust the key assignment below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality may be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the enclosed programs will give you a default .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and additional functions for creating new projects .
void copy@@ ri@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void release @-@ format@@ ted ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Quartet ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String Quartet ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Quartet ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Quart@@ z )
this makes it possible to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Sel@@ ection for &amp; k@@ de ; it can easily be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders that code these wa@@ v files ( compressed ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they are installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ up@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install anything yourself . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed that are needed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to crack the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware des &amp; CD ; / DVD device covers the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid purchasing a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily usage for reading a &amp; CD ; will be explained on the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , over which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example there are more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
start the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data according to the setting of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog - coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab .
opens the file manager so that an already expi@@ red file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , picks ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; ex@@ iting ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various card flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , setting the enco@@ der ) . here , you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercially available devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG releases is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has a very high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires more than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR together stereo , compression rate app . 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a title . good gen@@ u@@ g for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ les , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : this is the author intended ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is public on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway on a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively choose a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , it may be used with a different ( forged ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more , look in the source code ... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this has not yet been done .
for saving the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after the installation of a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading criteria on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine as it is regarded as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write per@@ missions on it ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reader program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the General Pre@@ ferences tab . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen shot .
select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card map CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , if a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; tag and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to enter anything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card map .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD should get ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load will be distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as first try .
both work equally as to the server , but since many fire@@ walls clo@@ g the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously reading pieces : excuse , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; throw out at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this folder , then / must be specified in the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for limiting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive is running . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , is described in the previous section as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look slightly different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then look for help in the section and return to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the CD can be picked up successfully by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the artist &apos;s name and album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that will suit your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; input field , unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comment@@ aries per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. , if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desired remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help file for more information .
simply select an entry that matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
caution : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if the selection process is started by clicking on the button selection , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on .
click on the rider orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we &apos;ve entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous retri@@ eval and coding ( but two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any locking point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may do it . at least only after making contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing to this proposal .
strange , if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ jan game of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically detects the procedure used each time .
session support . if you want to quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open it ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the Edit menu or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving with the knob back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the template and change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar affects the space bar as a pressure on the Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the piece , interrup@@ ts the playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use texture , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically determined using a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust anything . so if you select the automatic text selection entry in the Settings menu , the Kar@@ aoke text will be automatically selected .
if you want to set an event type , select from the Settings menu the entries text events or song events . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open the collection manager first . you can find it in the menu Collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each item in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to Collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is enabled and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the turn from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to skip a song , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; c@@ mid ; it is not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General @-@ Midi @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano into events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always allows a trumpet to be heard when a piano was originally supposed to play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the pre@@ condition for this is that each occurrence has different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section speci@@ fies how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the word drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always equal drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as are its presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . take a look , for example , the included Key@@ words .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to replace the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on that channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch benefit event with the value n , this is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard , which gets a pitch benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes higher up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , It@@ em MIDI Settings menu
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point Channel View : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen when you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; open on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open up A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this inspir@@ es me , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I therefore want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful mic and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and see pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .

the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defini@@ tive Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . when you select an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; Current play &apos; , TV and persistent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can do this only if &amp; KM@@ Player ; you can also choose the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / app . simply click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the Edit menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when you leave edit mode or select another group without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end of the animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the displaying of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ . &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / bodies ; &amp; lt ; / bodies ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file , just like installing the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in the Setup dialog File Associ@@ ations of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , check the Back@@ end output inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always use a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e @-@ type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ el , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source are used by KM@@ Player .
is there any hint as to how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why must my CPU be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t@@ . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is used to compile &amp; box .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package and ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact information should be made via the Ki@@ le ; website .
if you have any questions , or if you want to compile &amp; box , please refer to the Ma@@ iling List Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to experience , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct output : hold @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a lay@@ man ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is just a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to rule correctly , good books , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 will be used .
just like other mark@@ up languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics like paper format , page number@@ ing and text formats are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Assistant by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for the creation of the document . some settings can also be made to the document .
document classes : this is used to obtain the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , Brief &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; projector &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration only have to be washed in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , a book ( DIN ) , a report ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN provisions ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source text editors - the emphasis on the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matched ones ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is quite prob@@ able that some mathematical surrounding is not closed . however , you &apos;ll notice it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and enh@@ ancements through the high@@ lighting time .
with automatic execution of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically create a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the added line to the command of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu Settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective icon .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; exec@@ utable file ) was created , navig@@ ating &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the common output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the map search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as it was cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . the preview search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a paragraph in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the corresponding link is entered in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be set about project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no bugs in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is installed on the &apos; internal &apos; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick @-@ fitting .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , you should see the three large selection fields . the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box For further information is available for items such as keywords , filling notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( choice over a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files may also be written in &amp; box ; manually written .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ man@@ e is used for the definition of font sizes . it can be used to specify the font sizes for the main text , the seam marks , etc . there are the following fonts to be available :
when calling &amp; box , there are two options available : 1 . the wizard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings .
the braces after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the push button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; records storage automatically .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the recording . if it is used with rapid construction &amp; Ok@@ ular , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be noted .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size of 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font .
changes occur only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands termin@@ ate either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c expression and is active as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be shown recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is represented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; box follows .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , a quotation , a few places in bold and ital@@ ics , and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( provided the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar permits the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion to desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ selection enables the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern can be set up in Settings box ... Construction tools must be selected .
in order to execute the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ eces set up ... editor )
should a mistake occur when using Fast@@ ing the &amp; DVI ; a bug may exist . if a bug is available , this will be summ@@ ar@@ ised in the log file or in the message window .
the log file lists the sources of error in the source code . in the editor you can use the buttons of the La@@ Te@@ X error and the La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between the errors . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . to view the faulty line , the error should be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once cli@@ cked on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , please see the section .
most commonly used users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File template from document ...
when creating a new document from a new document using File New , some strings are replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings General set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , you can create your own template instead of the standard features .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for a template on the Internet and use the steps described below .
&amp; box ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more , and its opportunities to experience , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the men@@ ue La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &apos; \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many Wi@@ zard can enter additional jumping marks . it is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit jumping marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already outstanding features have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; speci@@ fies always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection are included :
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning , as this command also sel@@ ects &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , this can be cut first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ unds ; offers the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit a paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le provides ; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command we jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded brackets .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the wei@@ ghted clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted cur@@ ly braces can be lost quickly the overview over . this command includes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy note signs are used as G@@ Ã ¼ n@@ Ã ¼ s@@ schen . for the practical implementation it is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple note signs is used . also for the end of the transfer the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and adds two exclusive license plates for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double lock token can be set under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
foreign language settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) can also be used in foreign languages . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting shift ; enter key &amp; kick ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command .
within a table -@@ environment lock &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an enclosed line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings box ; Set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in spread@@ sheets -@@ Environ@@ ments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; following the next tab in the above line .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already having a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different working modes under Settings box ... fully set .
at the beginning a new environment by means of the \ \ begin { surrounding } will &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , as a result , the complete list can be gra@@ ded . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled down by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jumping tok@@ ens may be frozen , so that a simple jump to these positions means possible jumping tok@@ ens and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters of the general language use .
command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the full @-@ space inv@@ oc@@ ation will result in a large e list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the full @-@ space change over the Men@@ tioned environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this has been done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; box ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item -@@ command is added .
settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up in Settings box ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word completion mode has been changed over the menu Edit Str@@ g + Alt key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large e ro@@ wers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many others in a document are written more than once . thus , it offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le completely grin@@ ds down . here also the threshold for the display of the complete damage can be specified .
the completed files can be installed in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ ble home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphics dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog forms the input of graphics as simple as possible . to view the fundament@@ als of graphics formats , the sections should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to view the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by the Alt ; 2 keyboard . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file using the old ; 4 by using the old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project is being asked about the project New Project .... Hier@@ bei will ask the following information for the project :

the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; box .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts is in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :

this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k containing a database with all to &amp; box ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; will then only be shown the results .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; c ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , eliminating &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; installed OS @-@ X .

the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the fake in &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used .
to install a plug @-@ in or a new part , we start editing with the Edit Plugins menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves as a unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears gre@@ asy after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for more information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event for information can be made to team leaders when something certain happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project , so that later you can see how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will insert a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees chosen in the recipient list . address sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments by the following things :
there can be either the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , has a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog stretches over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with regard to tags , including car complete , can be changed . the entries are :
size / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attribute . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case signi@@ fies that attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the button standard , the def@@ aults can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in a different way as file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis , so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is per@@ plex@@ ed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the location to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep is to be opened automatically when changing the structure tree . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting short@@ cuts ( some kind of templates ) that can be deployed when editing too large text . abbrevi@@ ations are grouped into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ config abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plu@@ gins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not located at a stand@@ ar like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select enables saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as of version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , which adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . appears normally in the left corner .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . appears normally in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution proceeds . if a de@@ bug is given , execution starts as soon as a request is asked .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible in functions and include , will be adjusted .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there is no current one .

with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic bodies of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see details for conversion details .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ ging XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the day . descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a typing error .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but a single element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only for the type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies an attribute of a tag . this element can only exist once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a chi@@ pping and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ Name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that summ@@ ari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of items that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that termin@@ ate a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to start and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . dialog box . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ ging file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ ging file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ around = &quot; function = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , at@@ tain@@ able via D@@ TD Edi@@ te D@@ TD settings . this can be edited by Edi@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be created with Settings actions ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut short@@ cut for this action . clicking the user defined button can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the Schnell@@ start -@@ Dialog or the various Lo ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir directive in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts local scrip@@ ting folder : $ P@@ AT@@ H / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if only one instance is running the text will be added unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script may receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
the output of the exported application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the default output . it can be specified what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output drop @-@ down menu :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar has been added , you have to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Visual other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this icon will start ; start ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable addition of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user there is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . repository if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # items in the main index Top Element = &gt; Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html sections 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html sections 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html sections 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html sections 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see in the &amp; PHP manual page now :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the contents section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to design context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is indicated . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file attachment lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c by $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at various points there is an Email @-@ sending menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send by email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make an adult &apos;s contribution , we recommend signing the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can search for one .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and sign@@ alling . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages which are not currently supported by &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ ging XML . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD shop and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion to the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in order to understand and gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first acquain@@ t themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain these concepts precisely to them , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the division is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars about actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user folder , so that it can only be used by this user .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ beds the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and tool@@ bars . please go in , and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can click on the map fron@@ trun@@ ner with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all flash@@ ers , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , if the string is a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue with different fields .
the Tree Con@@ si@@ bilities ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the categories are always available , local templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh of the tree will be opened .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ ly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system geared to the content enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , by the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus has ; two flash@@ backs at the bottom of the window to be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD will be displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts which are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation can be found with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look in the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; en@@ rol@@ ment so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; en@@ rol@@ ment which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script prints error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and switching of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent integration means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting tool bar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click it . click on a activated plu@@ gins turn off .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the one ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which matches the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . Main Window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .

a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which ones and change the sequences .
this should generate help in line with the mouse poin@@ ter environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in a financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be automatically completed . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , etc . ) you have to proceed differently .
note that if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to coup@@ ons .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed using the Shift @-@ F@@ 7 button .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project opens , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
Up@@ load profiles can be uploaded to profile sections ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by putting a separate tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at this time .
to open another project , select Project ... from the Project menu or the Symbol project opens from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows you to select a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are opened and opened with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only more one profile , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten with Progra@@ ming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk storage option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time saving function or a risk . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply del@@ eting the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best managed using the tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition differ . the addition of tool@@ bars is discussed at the bottom of the Add tool bar section .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions like tool@@ bar can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog , where actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common file system with expanded organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
some of them with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation before use .
binary patterns are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are placed in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is to be inserted again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template ...
once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insert via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project file , you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template to create and secure a name for the template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or connect dynamically to &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ ter@@ istic attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list . if a root folder is set to such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be in a root folder .
allows pre@@ programmed or im@@ printed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( click on it , press the right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second editor shares the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source editor if needed , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . PHP is still the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , this mode is already active , pressing the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; view you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for quick calcul@@ ators and a large margin for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select tools for document properties . it is also possible to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of looking out pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor is strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a feedback button or a distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before inser@@ ting tags is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding ar@@ mature day .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the Listen Assistent are disabled . they will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheets can be followed .
to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to successfully compile , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
stop in a template in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned handles can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command checks on a partial or complete agreement with a for@@ age named QNAP or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP who contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a prompt stopping point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts while merging .
the program I used showed only the modified lines , but I could not see exactly what was changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , just copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
one function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes . the merge @-@ editor between the differences windows allows the resolution of conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files while merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and mim@@ ics the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to frequently check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder folder folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folders folder
opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will open your selection and will display it next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
via the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration dialog opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start merging / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , upload them to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse take a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merging ) well to see .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line will be scored at broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the output output : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summ@@ ation column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also indicate a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the dispens@@ ing window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . by inser@@ ting the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insertion and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture Ab@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark into the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is checked , whatever you select is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the clip@@ board content .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 based systems use cart return + new@@ line drive \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps track of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting &gt; &gt; K@@ F@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c font will be displayed . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an un@@ altered color .
if this option is enabled , when the tab key is pressed , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press En@@ ter or Return , the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board will then be removed .
you can select which type of line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all of the identical rows in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . also when merging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while other files with different sizes are identical in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison though they are different .
this option is de@@ activated in default . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
this option is de@@ activated in default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is passed on .
removes automatic all conflicts in white marks using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge . look for details in the documentation to compare and merge .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for encoding a short notice is displayed , which is local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn off this to supp@@ ress up@@ lifting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply delete the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge operation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example , to cut out annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal processor command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processor command for line trun@@ cation to convert input into upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a gra@@ ceful expression that matches all characters in one line . \ \ 1 in the replace string refers to the found text in the first clip . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
the \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ RC@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / Re@@ p / Er@@ tags / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for displaying and merging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the merge and merging of single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the folder scanning , only the files that have been compared until then will be listed .
when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merging operation cannot be chosen automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colours A / B / C use the colors red , green , yellow and black .
however , for identical entries the colour is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is green only , then becomes yellow and later when it is old red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then investigate &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started .
when merging , a file is processed after the other . it status column shows ready when merging is successful , and other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is al@@ right all over .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ F@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . once you have selected all the merging actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , then in the three folder merging mode C is used as the target , B is chosen as the target while synchron@@ izing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only select the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options per@@ missions , simul@@ ating and Canc@@ el .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merging window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work with the next entry will continue .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that should help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries have been merged individually , it notes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and does not merge them at the later merging of all entries . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ F@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when left to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is switched off , the links are compared to normal folders and searches recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is disabled in default .
complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders across a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to the revision date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . the results from the merge of files are stored in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is regarded as uns@@ af@@ e , because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge views always remain visible to merging individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch off the option directory &amp; text window and switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder association .
this status is lost , however , if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative . it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished by showing a link to a file or folder . then , a file is always accepted as a link object . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the option Trust of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch file to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and choose from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ RC@@ 3 already points out that it can run together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by taking a look at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not treated as identical .
the editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has so far been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit greater amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !

only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current version of the program you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Ref@@ resh feature after changes to these options . )
there are only entries displaying the differences . this also leads to the fact that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain those files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C font below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual work@@ tops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working surface and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and exit . however , if an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , maxim@@ ise , on desktop and exit . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
when this field is enabled , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field to indicate the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ tops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this box is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
if this box is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with their default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work surfaces are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very well suited for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ Program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... let the dialog box appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ d . if you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or login to your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of K@@ DE base packages .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use with &amp; K@@ mag ; a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ sensitive machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as selection box below .
the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is shown in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the Shift ; Shift or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use it , you can move the drop @-@ down window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the display update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically re@@ stores your pres@@ et short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and decrease &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can magni@@ fy an area of the screen , as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ets for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain that arises when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere desire of the mouse . if you suffer from pain related to your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to clarify this again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
is the intelligent shift activated , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulated pressing the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way you can pull the drag with pressed mouse button . the intelligent sliding requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if Intel@@ ligent Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime .
this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to speed the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a sli@@ ders sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to automatically launch a program there .
res@@ ets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last press is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later shift the intelligent shifting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick in doing so is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shift in this case , this means that the operation is no longer possible by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . but you can park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy and paste text into the clip@@ board or run any other action where you want to move the mouse over with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using it . instead , highlight text as follows : at the end of the text area , select a mouse click and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and clicking the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is done every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shifting time begins . later you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor arrives . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome who have pain in the mouth of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a certain time is waiting for a pulling action before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the text output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text Pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages used without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the vocabulary for vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the language chosen to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
when you have a mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the wor@@ ding page and K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding with the text passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using kt@@ ts@@ d as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Dem@@ on which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a passage in the menu text passages or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of immediate words the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered into the input field first .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pas@@ sage@@ way should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text Pass@@ book is not saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ way is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ itory page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can specify the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . the frequency of each word is simply calculated by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts in the dictionary , over time you create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the short@@ cut short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ sage@@ way , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , the tool@@ bar or using a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the feed memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the feed memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected sets of the feed memory .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly below the menu bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages with entries will be displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you did not use the command for the voice output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the map language output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
festival is a speech edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use festival for free and without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the lyrics in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA to use for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German lyrics to phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax happily swal@@ lows down the last sign of the text , so an additional sign must be app@@ ended . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; d@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be on .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ more language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to do this , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text output through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences can be saved , which the user can spend time again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include any language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module consisting of modules that allow any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer willing to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . there are also interesting possibilities for users .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; even if &amp; boards ; embedded in other &amp; c ; applications .
the speech output is performed by the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background music such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .

before you can use , you must install and set speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no or@@ ators installed , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the flash@@ card general will be displayed .
most T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used as the default speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card front speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the cardboard card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker has been set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls vote to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the speakers card . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the flash@@ cards General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text orders .
if you have installed at least one speaker , you can launch the &amp; k@@ de language output system . click the General tab on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card map will be shown and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de .
if kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the output field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar when reading , it will disappear as soon as the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with buttons in this series you can start , cancel , pause and record text orders .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card order is displayed only once K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; check the text that is to be read and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always wise to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step as well , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ amps and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; k@@ de ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text to read , and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you about the events you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read more .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . by &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry displays al@@ erts in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filtering works , it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read before , the retained orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the highest priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are reading &amp; eg ; reading a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every job you go@@ vern orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and ended .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
character plac@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string box filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a more understandable way .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Converter uses an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of supply of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the speakers card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , he continues the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a message ; -@@ notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for setting of string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Cre@@ ate . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only be allowed to enter .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter apply when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison to words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( space ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; print@@ outs can be found in the package node .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such formats . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , set up on the card speaker or to a speaker with specific properties . you can , for example , specify that text should be read from a female voice by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers set up on the card by the speakers . you can over@@ write the chosen speaker with the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help in entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , closest to the requested requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog window selection .
use these buttons to store or load your speakers or delete all settings .
the Spre@@ er selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must register at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; to give programmers their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice @-@ output API by &amp; k@@ de ; see the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package c@@ de@@ activating with &amp; kt@@ ts ; find it in the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . also , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ mean@@ our ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore consult the description of the Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information not included in this manual .
the &apos; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand , use another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile it , you need a new development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the developer files for the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program .
if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for past@@ ing or downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first copy of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat , pause , or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in .
if you click Add to Add to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the speaker device is displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages like ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sliding controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey , the voice you choose will not allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the icon kt@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely processed sentence . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the ID column on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
text orders are listed and managed here . issues of screen readers , al@@ erts and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50 % ; % corresponds to about half and 200 % ; % approximately the double normal talk speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map only apply to normal text orders . for messages , al@@ erts and spending of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to pre @-@ read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , launch kt@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .
select this check box to switch the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . default sel@@ ects the speaker that appears in the list on the cardboard card speaker as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All messages for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the default messages as follows :
use the Save button to load the settings for the noti@@ fications into a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events listed in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries other than All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the configuration for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this lets &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add more set filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker is to try it . switch off the speakers selection and select text to read . switch on the speakers selection again , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then pause or cancel orders on the card map , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal slider recognition filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tabl@@ ature sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits . ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before the filter ) . note that the default trace element recognition filter keeps the set setting .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ron@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal sentence recognition filter by default , you can paste it again by up@@ loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card selection list , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card map is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the features of a set subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; mark ; otherwise select &amp; trac@@ ts ; design@@ ate the speaker closest to the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not matter , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker button and then use speaker that matches the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; trac@@ ts ; it has been killed . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x the command follow @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by this , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you may try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . when I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA are occurring that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find clu@@ es for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / fes@@ tival@@ pin / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
there is a setting speed on the audio card audio . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ atical modules such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) disable either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but I kt@@ am ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a set of string replacement filters and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or return . on the cardboard market orders are displayed , the job consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . instead , use a filter for this character recognition .

some users experience conflicts in the audio output related to AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze when you stop a text order and start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real p@@ auses . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read at the end .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ;
you must install at least one language . help is found in the instructions provided with the Festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software into festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to type in the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , look for Festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set up to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then , festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phone from German lyrics .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; this allows managing network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network configuration module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded if the network settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting non @-@ again , the definition can be permanently taken .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning that the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter system administration mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the setting of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... Set@@ ting up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection automati@@ cal , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be done . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine if the desired address is already in use . if in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . switch on an off @-@ off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host on the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain input by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ en@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org requests , DNS picks up this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution system allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or descending or descending into the list with the buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ unter in the priority list .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the Add Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group machine to the name resolution , select one entry and then click on the Edit ... button will be shown in the Edit dialog .
name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . first and foremost , it is used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of name @-@ known calcul@@ ators contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP will replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press En@@ ter several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry from a name known to name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your machine will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command is disabled .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changes in configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is communicated .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point that applies a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 PCs .
in addition , net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 45 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if a different content is found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

alternatively you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; s . changes or additions to tasks or variables only become active .
it appears the default k@@ de ; print dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar that provided the Ab@@ ility of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective zi@@ pping . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; do the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . don &apos;t recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t see the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by a change in the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can use data to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before using , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; continuing with format@@ ting the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before hitting the backup , you need to select the files to be secured . it can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings .
if you confirm the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
check the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the verification process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for review .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the recovery process has started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery .
if you confirm the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system will be backed up , such as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the other file system .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time the documentation was created .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ ited &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is bound , the command blows load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the spin at the tape drive . possibly this setting will not work for all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware @-@ size block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape formats , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only record a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
the band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the band was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different log files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access to information about problems occurring on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features that allow the individual protocol lines to be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - open . if this is not shown , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system management privileges . the protocol files usually find themselves under Linux in the / var / log directory , for which normal users usually have no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or set string . enter a string into the filter bar . the list of log lines is now automatically displayed , so that only log lines are displayed . in the default setting , the selection box contains the entry All . then a log line is displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can , of course , select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . in addition , in the Log File System Protocol , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important log lines . speed lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as minutes lines of step critic . the color representation of minutes rows can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identi@@ fier ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can switch the option to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display several log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more current information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and named so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the Linux ; world . and , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to start when starting the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for the in@@ it in different places and starts the first one that it finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning area you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you come to fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably will see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; one server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; start .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ ning and change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range .
the number of entries in the entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the Sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another level , move it to the clip@@ board with cut @-@ out ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired rank level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or name of an item manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the En@@ ter button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine is constantly starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ time to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but is unfortunately not standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg , Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without news if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the Run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tion of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save file in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group by double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have set advanced system settings . only if you have activated space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card is created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management card menu appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if a fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with wild@@ card restriction .
the Groups tab informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , you will find in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the batch dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user on the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove , and change the boot password , change the time to the boot of the default operation system , remove the default operation system , remove , change , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
