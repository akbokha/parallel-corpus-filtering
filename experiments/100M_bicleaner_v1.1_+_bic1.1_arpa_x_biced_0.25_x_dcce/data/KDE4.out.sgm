<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in the & Conqueror; menu under Extras Site. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire page.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by the Babelfish page itself, where you can paste text into translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions by & konqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & Conqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde; addons package. please note that perhaps more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & Conqueror; on Tools Cancel. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Positive filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar under Extras views filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; s current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in the & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, example: DVI element, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Module & FSView; for & Conqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in plotting nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you can see.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling options.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over color mode, can either display depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying, or if the area is used by lower rectangles. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps display algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView; this target is not always observed. it is drawn frames to indicate the nesting of entries, and this frame will need space, which is then lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How dividing the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses by frame always advantageous to divide the areas so that rectangles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you call the module image gallery, a dialog opens which allows you to specify the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option image per line has a slider and a rotation box to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box filename of the image, specify whether the filenames will be displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown in the thumbnails under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you determine if the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="31">In the File Selection in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box in the subfolder, you can set with a slider or a rotation range until at which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the original images to copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the commentary file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box selve color depth, you can set a different color depth for thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the F9 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & Conqueror's navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; add the browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to access the & konqueror; hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & html; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed using this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam, albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gPhoto2 library. of course each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works entirely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam, an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains one entry problems or wishes... This opens a dialog with a signed connection. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means that the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam; however, you may have questions to other users of & digikam; however, you may soon be speaking English, you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digikam, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. simply enter path names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data output is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also use you as an Albencopy.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as base folders. & digikam; view each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; During recursively the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude sub-folders, unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by adding a dot in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Submit to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digikam; perhaps also circumventing it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoderm settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam, albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gPhoto2 library. of course each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may be used to connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the digikam preview images can be read out reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgPhoto2, you might be unable to see thumbnails or production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digikam, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam, even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures everywhere: you can cast a picture in another part of the Albenedim, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to undo the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment. thus, the filter on the file name only works if it is shown in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed can be configured in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My AlbenListequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos, edited by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imported Images scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to highlight your albums so you can group together under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos by selecting items from the toolbar or collection items. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: will be used when you sort your albums after date by viewing albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Oldest, average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is to help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you probably want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, click on the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections always have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a while while thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu for all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the preview. what information is this, you can change the settings digikam; set up. select here the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you want to let the mouse cursor enter a moment over a picture, the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Images and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to it. you can reach all the features that have been edited with & digicam; you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by right-clicking either F4 Image Edit... or selecting the contextual menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit....</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the File menu. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing other image processing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data with you when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for shooting. the easiest is to right-click on the preview and select Turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right-click on preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del. if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My date slidequot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keywords, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported at the loss of the database as soon as it is digitized; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keywords; or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword, this will become the underword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword, clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to insert the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">It can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keywords.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have edited a photo with keywords, this will be displayed under the thumbnail of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Remove. the menu will only show you the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view displays a timelogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved by this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Near the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds hit. if you click here, the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has not found anything then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above. you can also save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search is performed. the results will be displayed in My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just need to select the corresponding entry from View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit searches, the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you can find more rules for the search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albencopy. all rules are listed in line by operators. any option can be added to this list with Search Group / Search Group. each option can be associated with others through the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... You can also search for the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes any picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar. by using a swellist, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-free sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the matching pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble MiniProgram. you can drag it or zoom out or hold it. move it while you click the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this is then added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofile.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, even raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightening table from the contextual menu. the selection is added to the lightbox and its window opens. if you are back in the menu, you can quickly open the illuminator with L Extras lamp.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place them there. a small arrow tells you what copy in which window area can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures. if you use pair-mode navigating from the toolbar, then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the sections for the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the illuminating table, e.g. F4 File Edit...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side panel of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated area. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; in the Mode preview, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Just use the zoom control below the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are previewing the zoom mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos again. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, evaluate, snug, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management adopts, indexed, categorized, secures, seeks, transforms, confectioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no longer to find a specific photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use it not & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access them with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be on your computer. you need to decide if you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend storing metadata in the Settings page of the metadata in & digikam; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? & digikam; it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you now need to assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or place the images in the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be done simply by pulling a sub-tree on another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to share your photos with anyone, you want to share it with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you that this is the landing field of Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream of having associations, memories, the historical time span is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who regard your photos, the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you want to show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him over the motif that has moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even exits you a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? wasn't Earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical data. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleMaps. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights in order to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the Direction Page of & digikam, as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support commas or semi-colons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you can see the picture on others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">The solution to this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-pros this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failures, power violations, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, desasterprevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years. whether you believe it lies in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash drives, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu-ray discs.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. please read the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark, dry and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discard manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives available on this topic: discard study</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: Disks last the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate increases dramatically with lower temperatures. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART cannot detect this error. some of the errors identified by SMART terminate the immediate impending failure. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make much power, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause severe damage. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blackheads is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy slots and provides the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector line. remember, however, that not every connector line also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system should also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage bumpers, which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV board.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks, and are therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to work even further until the current is running again. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. at the end, you should always remember how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures to have full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undiscovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data streams. in normal filesystems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its own filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms that use the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss at the notebook and 46% in the workstation systems. at notebooks, the percentage of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are moving towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorating. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anybody for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss. so back up your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the reinstallation of your operating system, the sharing of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then, one day, a lightning strike you are lucky if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. don't forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desasterbowbowbowing always means not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and reassess while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way than to forwards a certain vigilance.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been detected by the system, but do not append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available, you can create it yourself. this task is made from year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary patented format which slowly disappears from the market. it should therefore not be used anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard GIF must replace. however, it can store much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend Gamma- and Chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now making use of DNG and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon can use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the 'resource block quot; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to file their data in a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; that stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive your photo, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format will fail. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera are edited, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in web galleries, code them in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section Adding a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albencopy.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect these to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When the connection is made, a ready-to-use indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam, or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. while downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the images were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the selected selected button is digested until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. in this case, the new images have been marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons all download or download selected items, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album, in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed, like normal folders, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can all delete them at once by using the Delete All button. if you want to delete only a few, you have to select it first and then delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos you deleted from the camera. you should check carefully if the photos have been downloaded into a digikam; so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted. if you want to delete the camera file completely, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are usually reused after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can result in double filenames, if you upload photos from different recording studios to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for database-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data to the author in the standard auto-identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the Prefix foto-% Y-%%% H:% M:% S in the edit box. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in uppercase letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic spin during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Metadata page you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't supply this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam; this is used to automatically load sub-albums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subalbum.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case saved & digikam, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based subsection at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digikam; you know where to upload the images. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position that can be displayed in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser to indicate the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digior; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the positional data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitrailers and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated with GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with a psman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the GPX format as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of pictures and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy co-ordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com doesn't show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behaviour of & digikam; to access these settings, you must select in the Settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be previewed or edited on Embedded Preview. in this way, you set the default behaviour of & digikam; determine if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected while downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author line: this field should contain the photographer's job title. this can be labels such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture of others & quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this ensures that metadata is permanently stored in the image and not only in the database of & digikam, but this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without any loss.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image descriptions as embedded tags (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this means that your captions can also be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to indicate, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lightbox of & digikam, can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the illuminated button, these settings are not available. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, you can only get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar when using the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files option, you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor respond to sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference produces a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images receive more details in four steps in more detail. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is it the pointed lights, so the parts of your images which are burned in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as penetrating white. use the setting colors to trigger certain unusual results, as it shows the pointed lights in various rosatars. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shreters.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not satisfy as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstructing option, you get the option to set a level. here a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the editing options of the & digikam; image processing. to minimize the time for the demo, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo invoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or color-breaking design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcram provide three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenin Directed) was the first algorithm used by Drapw. it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading, as it is performed during the raw conversion process.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions such as these should be given back. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a color space to translate into the other is that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior If a picture is opened in the image processing / color-management module with raw file starts.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Use here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-Profiles You have here the possibility & quot; standard source; to store for your profiles. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile with which you can emulate how your image would be given by one device. this is very useful before you print image, because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for them. unfortunately, not for Canon models. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface can & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are then deleted by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) via KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left hand a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Auto recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in picture display mode. underneath are the serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass stores.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and switch it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, which is displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the trash bin, you can set the talk of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be implicitly applied by & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any questions. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & digikam the welcome screen; under certain circumstances, this accelerates the start process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Start after new photos forcing & digikam; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam; if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam; you know if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam, to adjust the main window to your taste. you can select these settings using the Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. you will find more information about the KIPI modules in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, showing the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and underneath the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this using File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restore or button The Restore button Restore button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last time it was saved.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. you can undo the last action by undo / restore undo by selecting reproducing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z for undo and Ctrl; -Turn-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; click the Return or Restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword, by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarger Automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the Settings dialog by & digikam; you can view it from the Edit Pane window.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or entire phrases. you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Wizard from the menu album Export Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it will be displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click, because the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button more. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating from the toolbar is applied to the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the sidebar is always applied only to one image. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written in the IPTC field of the urgency. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter keywords, keywords, and a box with the keywords mentioned before in this & digikam; -Session glossary.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this feature is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and you choose a keyword in the keywords tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to specify a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword-filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search-views. if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right-word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off under Settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly bought it & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish in the web that correspond to your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you can make informed decisions at every point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make sure that you have more information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another colour space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to connect to your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. if you work as a color space from sRGB, you either have to use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, Same, Automatic Compare and Contrast widen from the Correcting Automatic correction menu try to make the best out of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects in order to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalizes: this method scaled the luminosity values over the whole picture, making the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method uses the intensity channel of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same number of brightness results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it only produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because you can use a colour space with 8 bits per color. so if you are too far from the original picture you can perform overexposure. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the target picture. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The destination image preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right there is a histogram showing that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures that most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow Adjustment lets you improve or dimming the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make it exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings return all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as those for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour-mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. you can consult a detailed color management guide for the use of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for more than one photo. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you will find under Coldation Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">Die & digikam; Tool Farming effects provides you with four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solaris, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when a partly developed pressure was exposed to a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image was completed. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solaris. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase finally generates a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solaris effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called "Velviaot" effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment to experiment the different colour aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. even in this case, the brightness / saturation tool is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be previewed. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog appears very complicated for this tool, you only need the area of the slide. concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slides are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the regulator and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinks can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. additionally, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change the output values as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a fading image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and load it later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the histogram's input for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overall Indicator option controls all the color channels in order to find over-exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two icons to switch between linear and logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useful. in this case, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a crankcase to the right, i.e. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On previewing the original photos a red marker is visible. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you select this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overall Indicator option controls all the color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digikam channel blender; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color nuances of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The image preview has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminanz, the picture will retain the overall brightness even if you also activate the option Monochrome, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green-channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. color-brewing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Stores as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overall Indicator option controls all the color channels in order to find over-exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjusted. the option Luminanz store is activated. the original image is shown under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White photography has always been fascinating about your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford's HP5 Plus, Ilford P5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenery images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color adjustment and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Epiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit coldness to the mold tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digikam; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. in detail, the picture rounds with a colored line, Niepce rounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will have greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it using the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the image, the greater the character set needs to be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool template apply you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Picture Template menu can be used in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digikam; template database, just send an email in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resized: this button resized the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture. the image is then adjusted automatically to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools to focus. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharper mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalization process has to be merged with only minimal differences to a single color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur. the same phenomenon can be observed when dyes are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures a camera has often been applied in internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already apply a sharpener while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the focus.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful however, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing the tool. you can refocus it via the menu entry Correceren. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften the plasticized menu and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the sharper mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpens images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the blurred image added to the original. this sets the sharpness of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blur mask. refocus mostly reaches better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß 'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixies, which are far from the original quellpixel. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's folding is in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is Gauss. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular focus or the palate. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Upload Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any more refocused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the cutting, color and intensity correction on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before modifying the picture in any other way. the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible, but leave behind unpleasant artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking uses a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Wiener Filters it is possible to show that it is the optimum lens filter. in practice, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour that needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothes the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows for a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most sophisticated tool for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. weighed against larger values mainly homogeneous regions and make details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Straightening Indicence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is smoothed in 1 direction only. if you have a movie or CCD is a high value waving wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbaric effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-increments since [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is only minor, but it doubles the duration. therefore, we recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make it exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved to a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected using small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera. as you can see there is a unique black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is to be seen below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if it is elevated, roughness peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data can no longer be preserved and noise or greases occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it is not possible to remove the entire noise or smoke tip. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more severely smothered, but it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high can a smear occur.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the plasticized menu and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local faults that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the BeEnd button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can restore like a photo with uniformity rushing.. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected unter (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo, which was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts created by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">This & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixels of photos that have been kept with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression will feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel rate; and "quot; bright pixel rate; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual way to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button darkening. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the fitting dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard notices the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: an average of neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo formats, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise the sharpness effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filtering and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting corrector filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of shock absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of Vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting corrector reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminescence and contrast correction is also performed in the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree coefficient covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flattens the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the distant corners towards that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. negative values can be corrected toned distortions and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the inverted hallmark of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value re-scaled the image size and thus corrects the first grade. negative values increase while positive image resists.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog tells a preview of distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a toned correction, the effect would be apparent to the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse cursor over the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transformieren Random editing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as shots from front, frames and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is to be seen below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page that is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters setting film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option joining film granulation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photographs, as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film-grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers are mixing large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loosely from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy look especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film's effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. smoothes controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the artificness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and flatten 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. images whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">It works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monish landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the BeEnd button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharper: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotating the pixels by a center. this simulates the sharpness of a spinning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring of motion: blurring the image through horizontal motions of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: photograph taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Sharpness: blurred the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by means of random shift of pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: find the colour pool in the picture and blurring them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the picture into rectangular cells and then creates it, through the filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the BeEnd button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your picture. thus, it gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the Select tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter Regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops of the filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the modified image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transforming Turning or Transforming Cats menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you restore or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Edit Quantity in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm image bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retained aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. it can be used as text file and can be recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo Baking is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the BeEnd button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo bubbles below by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. image processing allows this very easy. to cut a photo you simply need to use the mouse only the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and moving the rectangle, you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The Ctrl button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding the aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in high-format, the larger value of the height and in the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folding the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly aid make it possible to dazzle aid so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal of achieving good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition results in the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye directs in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can be placed a static object dynamischer.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal View and Vertical options can be used to reflect the harmonic expansions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam, image processing and the tool free rotation. select transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider back to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transformer cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically Zumming. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after shooting. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">For a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes on the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scaling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using horizontal and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single shot this effect is mostly negligible, but two shakes produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to crop the image with transform cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on its system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done by the file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it will change. you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam; see the configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw picture format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw Image Converter from & digikam; in the Configuration section, you can find further information about the use of Modular modules.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports the loading of raw images only with the dcraw program, which is included in & digikam; with this, more than 200 raw file formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are often stored in AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam, but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built-in capabilities to display or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digikam, the & kde; settings to play movies use to start playback.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to make photo editing are included in & digikam; your description will follow.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softer, noise reduction, refocus, sharp masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; Texture Application quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left panel shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally split without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">The upper section shows the original and the lower part compared to the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'Mouse over '-Style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame for selecting the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo characteristics: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble MiniProgram. you can drag it or zoom out or hold it. move it while you click the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallets files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets files installed by & kde can either apply to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal Folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets, or browse folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown in the palette view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the colour next to it. the color is described in the Palettes view. here also the color name can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used for selecting. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box is activated by the Add Color button, the color is inserted from the color chart on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the mode overwrite is selected. this mode can be set by selecting the overwriting check box under the cursor cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section, can be used together with the Copy, Cut and Paste actions.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color, three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a pointer character if another color follows. if there are three numbers in the clipboard, these can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color chooser can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs included & graphviz; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphically; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphically; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & sound; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & multipliers; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & posters; re-computes the graph and represents in & kgraphiviewers;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & posters; open or open the graph in & kgraphically; in one & c; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. required are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphically; without argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more of the dot; -files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the scroll wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zoom in both directions is limited by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction in a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file was changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphically; can also remember your decision, so that later will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item settings kgraphically.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside of an ongoing & kgraphicviewer; instance, in the file browser or in the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphically viewer; instance, or display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose if the parts of the graph that come on one page should be matched to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Side preview with one on several pages distributed graphene without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Reconnect Page provides the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically upload or ignore the changes) or leave the program any time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the ability to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewers; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can specify a default behavior in this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the ability to specify the start behavior of & kgraphiviewers; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or determine to be asked at every start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBn; appears, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the page of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible edge overlaps.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for graphene graphene. it produces depictions according to the springboard model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm produces for ungerified graphene a springboard model layout. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circularly in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should specify the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can & eg; the & graphviz; algorithm modifies special options, or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of the graph (directed or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungerified graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this, you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values of your own to select your image. look at the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have clicked the button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the image file appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files are created. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create the image file.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the importing &gt; screen shot in the menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas you should select this delay high enough to have the time to go there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialogue Options dialog appears with the options already described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar does not currently have any documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is your ID to Flickr. a browser will be started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is launched twice, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current permissions permissions that the module displays. currently, you will not need any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, you can upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as tags during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the public, friends and family options, you can set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in the size. the size is taken from the value of the maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio stays constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool for exporting your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for localization allows to add and edit the GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data are stored in the EXIF key words of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the celestial coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above dialog appears. to allow a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data recorded at the same time in the same places as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera space must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates a top deviation for the GPS time and camera position. if the deviation is below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from one place for images, you can manually edit the GPX file and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolating and Different in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a location lies in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog box sees the coordinates of a call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and increase it. always select the region in question until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the hexidool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select those albums. the albums will not be displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below, the Albenign preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab look defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each picture a page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings, where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, it also affects file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window will show the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred while generating. the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client's KIPI module is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then retrieve the Import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at hexid2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Enter Module is a tool to convert a set of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length, .This module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create the module using Extras mpeg slides.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds the image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all the settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow whenever you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indicator appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that is to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same, and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later, you should not select the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata stored in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the if information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the option to automatically overwrite existing file. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non proportional: non proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing Preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be shown with the images selected by you. you can add more images using the button Add images. for the last selected image a preview will be displayed on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Pictures button, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format Menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Iifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau will appear a window with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL output option in the presentation enables very elegant display operations using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name display ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it using Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images by chance ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, any transition between the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting up an image as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with comments, you can browse with & cphotoalbum; browse through these browsers, see the picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, thus in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annotated your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to store your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display pictures beside the names, select the button located on the right outside on the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image preview window (in more detail) and select the category editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the preview window you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call the Find item in the main window, a dialog appears to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can see this dialog box again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options at the bottom of the window, you can browse all the pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures, on which Jesper, however, not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kPhotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kPhotoalbum; and watch the fast entry, screenshots and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start & sing photoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kPhotoalbum; demo. you will then download some sample images and you can try the functions from & photoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you can find it on the homepage of & kPhotoalbum; as a connected HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you Dates statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview pane from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select a range, you will only browse images of this time frame in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar in the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kPhotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kPhotoalbum; integrated version that you can create through the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the moment and a description which the HTML file should contain later. on kPhotoalbum; HTML-Example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether to create a & kPhotoalbum; -Export file to be viewed on the overview page. read more about export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, all images are from a party. note that all images are exported from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why this page is not dealt with specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this means those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no longer download images which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer on your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder is saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, correctly works you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have all three related to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may of course want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., you will have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and importing.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that you can pass this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kin file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file looks for the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images that you can access through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">At option Manual to copy to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy the Automatically to the .kim file copy to copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. as most of the pictures were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import... selecting, it will import & kPhotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Imports Wizard consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the importing images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of people of the importing file personer (if you are a domain) while this category is called people. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the porting file to be imported, and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can check the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps taken from (1) Determining the information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoalbum; notices the folder where your images are stored and uses them again for future starts. if you want to read another database in & kPhotoalbum; so if you want to start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & sing photoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kPhotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kPhotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will see the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols with which you can access the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is provided that you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how to set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">View the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e., all members of a group at one time in a group rather than all groups of a mediator as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of options listed above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoalbum; share your module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kPhotoalbum; they are distributed separately, but most of the modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kPhotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database can be viewed either via the command line with the command &gt; kPhotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I didn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & kPhotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums: this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order after albums for some modules to enable you to use the functions with & sing photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kPhotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, we also have to release a list of albums. here we go & sing photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you are, for example, the category characters, will do & kPhotoalbum; so do so, so if you would have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & kPhotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setting dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you have a photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. at the moment, you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kPhotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the people on the picture, where the image has been taken. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if for example, it is illustrated on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting up people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kPhotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to relocate the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and the same 5-10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures, you can, by doing so, move the names used upwards, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image separately, you may still want to edit all selected images and annotate them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons located at the top right of the image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and use the menu item for multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window displaying the USA as an overboard. to show you that this is an overgroup, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it an sub-category of this entry. note, this requires you to sort exactly your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and / or moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">When you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options..., which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then close the window. you can see this procedure in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't set a filter. you can see the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this will appear in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and select either the Delete key or select Delete the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed which you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can also use them without having saved them on the hard drive. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere, so that you can record them in the database. in the picture you see the View from & kPhotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that you can view the preview of these images. you can, however, not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and copy it back again. so far, if you want to avoid the insertion of the respective CD, please buy a larger disk to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to make inaccessible and click Recent View in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, and unlock the menu entry Everything apart from the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures to be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all the images on the hard drive and on the other hand, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all of your pictures with & kPhotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, it has & kPhotoalbum; for this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see in. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and discard elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them and back by using the buttons image high and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Poss1 and End. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kPhotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can drag and zoom into the image. to zoom out, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key you can zoom in the center of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not drawn. with the single-key you set the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out using the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the Rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by putting the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture, where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have typed features on your pictures, these are available in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all of them at once with comments. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you want to view categories in dre preview view, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to work on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your painting later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In can you see a picture on which was painted. to switch on the Malmode of & kPhotoalbum; switch On the picture paint from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire-model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all the objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">In order to insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the Edit menu bar, or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message is displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can invoke the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview in the property view and a small example of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default the entire texture will be rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also save several window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below an existing view, drag the viewer to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the viewer to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on one another, drag the passer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to trigger a view from the anchorage, drag the attack on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the front panel.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the front panel. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with the window order... save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be installed properly. as this manual was written, was & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon The Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item Scene Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a fast preview to full-screen images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select View modes... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense, but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image cutout for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the drop down selector quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used to render. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection illumination. a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjacent pixel is included. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split again and again, because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 jets per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually followed and further subdivided. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the jet process called Jittering. if you turn ittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the item entry file import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; does not yet contain the complete command set of & Povray; if when importing error messages or warnings occurs, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Properties view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. please insert the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimetry data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object type of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail faithful to advanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a floor is rendered under the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When activating channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold values. detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window instructions or create new window instructions. in the section window instructions, you will see how you can create and save window instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing windows orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window instructions. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and select selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with flashcards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not anchored in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">When you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all wrong settings, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and icons often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Pane item. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry named camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later guidances, but note that the camera has control points to change the camera's target point. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the Apply button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert Endliche body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; provides actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, even at the moment, only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizon, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please choose your first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = Ground-Pigment), with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter the pigments settings. please always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the Quader and sphere preview, just click on the Apply button and then preview the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the object's view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step by step, as you should have already understood the basic mode of operation of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the button Appden), that the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would hover over the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now yields a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. set a suitable material in the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Once you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose Erstes subproperty and change the name for example in sphere pigments. click on sphere pigment, then select one-colored and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the screenshots below and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you want & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect. thus the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene that needs to be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage have been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last-made command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set preset short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can use this option toolset for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient visual viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file type, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Configuration - & kuickshow dialog; there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and Editing and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be set for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, loads & cuckshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still have the current image. this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; when closing the name of the recently opened folder. the next start will open & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the picture in the window mode, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed that can display the program as well.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; -short commands. this will make your keyboard to the & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist, and scripts. an example call for the DCOP-function break might be:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed due to a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use a dialog for the user to know why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates directory, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable executing external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Knows the script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now query & zb; with DCOP functions, further information on the new piece (such as metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also delivered to allow the script to use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storage of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packets are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as myskript.amarkascript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amarinoscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">If you already have a few playlists, you can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlists browser is the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should have no difficulty in compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, it has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>

<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser, which is not listed in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When you exit the playlist, the current playlist will automatically save when you exit from & Amarok;. enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you activate this setting, you will use & Amarok; relative paths to music files, starting from the playlists "location, otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping up-to-date piece during a piece changeover causes the playlist window to appear / unroll to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting proprietary scripts you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the selected color selector for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Restart at startup causes & Amarok; after program start, resume playback automatically with the piece at the point where it has been stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The On-Screen Display sub-window allows you to switch on the OSD. if you want to use on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if individual colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering space holders the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, enabling you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate further adjustments in this card map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, check the check box next to its name. this section also contains cross Fields for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok; all playlists found in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) will be added to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination panel driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, another device is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql set section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on calculator: where the machine is located on which the MySql database is located. after that, under port: the network port where the database is reached. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card win.fm directs the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">You can access the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package node and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, assume that your window manager is keeping the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, therefore we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by clicking ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file causing the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries used by & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the bug is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta info, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The $ARGV (0]); use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2 tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error in writing tags from $ARGA [0]\ "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any collifying Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">You can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok Channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please insert a bug there if you do something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; appears only a blank playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the File Browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you can find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the evaluation by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer Driver with the alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you to find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is for most people the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also encodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with the highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that the artswrapper suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like every normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can change through the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current Analyzer is displayed in an independent, larger window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display are also the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set alizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the play buttons, the volume control and the piece-position sliders. use the slide bar to adjust the piece position or volume. with the play buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the Equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players; it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, the navigation pane is on the left side. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser design. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows will later become more detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; if you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has been removed. the information displayed there is now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Tools Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover artwork of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to emulate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display covers images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest-rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all items in the individual sections to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try to download the text for the piece from the internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database. there is no running text script needed.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below it will be a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under Different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping interpreter / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by one another. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be sorted by genre and then sorted by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the collection settings. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly beneath the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. information on how to use this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you find a selection box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year. you can also select your entire collection, which allows the filter to be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">To transfer the pieces to media player, add the pieces to the media player in the queue. for more details, see the Media Player section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - opens the dialogue for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) move files in the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Highlighting a compilation-marking - Changes an album marked as a compilation step back into a normal album. after that, the album is no longer displayed under different interpreters but again under the associated artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the Playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter, sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. when the transfer is finished, quit & Amarok; and release the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Beneath the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL. if you are typing tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz, you can access music in the musi.tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: the dropping files are inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply entering the entries with the mouse to the desired location. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search words separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type in between the search terms OR, search entries are searched for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing whitespace, then enclose the search term with goose bumps: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller. for example: appraisal: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: - something searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key and then right-click in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side, you can find the Add to the playlist that you can add to the playlist.</seg>

CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info, lock and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read out audio or video CDs, provided that a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area which is only visible if the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it looks only pretty, and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>

<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality may be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can use either the dcop command line program or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the enclosed programs will give you a default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to be able to use the dcop command line, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have common all & kde; program common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and additional functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copyrif createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void release-formatted () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString Quartet) void addUrl (KURL:: list urls, QString Quartet) void renameItem (QString path, QString Quartet) void set VolumeID (QString Quartz)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -Selection for & kde; it can easily be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in wav files on hard drive) and by many encoders that code these wav files (compressed). currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These encoder packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution). additional encoders can be added to the program (if they are installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggupto (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install anything yourself. however, only the encoder packages must be installed that are needed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction on encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to crack the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware des & CD; / DVD device covers the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid purchasing a copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily usage for reading a & CD; will be explained on the hard drive. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, over which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example there are more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setting of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, picks) for program events (such as reading the & CD; exiting).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with various card flashcards (such as encoder, setting the encoder). here, you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercially available devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG releases is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has a very high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires more than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR together stereo, compression rate app. 11 128 kbps for all songs of a title. good genug for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs, so that all the others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation: this is the author intended) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is public on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway on a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; actively choose a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb, it may be used with a different (forged) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more, look in the source code... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After the installation of a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading criteria on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc.) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this won't succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine as it is regarded as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg; trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it for each reading of a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reader program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The General Preferences tab. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / typed as shown in the screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card map CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is easier, if a & CD; entry is found, immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename will be changed with Conqueror &gt; tag and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please keep in mind: if you want to enter anything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freedb in the offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know what data the CD should get? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load will be distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as first try.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as to the server, but since many firewalls clog the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, because the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously reading pieces: excuse, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try it himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; throw out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want to cross this folder, then / must be specified in the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something must be flipped to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is on average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for limiting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest like in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard drive is running. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, is described in the previous section as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look slightly different from those for a & CD; with successfully fetched data obtained from freedb. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, now the & CD; in the drive defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then look for help in the section and return to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD can be picked up successfully by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the artist's name and album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that will suit your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the 'Actual Title' input field, unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual commentaries per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g., if all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help file for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; -data anyway. for more information go to the freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Caution: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is started by clicking on the button selection, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read to the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears if you are trying to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we've entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3. this allows you to read and code in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous retrieval and coding (but two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions include a pre-compiled package, since & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; package. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons compiled by source files, and not intended for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>

<seg id="1611">A program that invokes many different programs has many variants of settings. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different flashcards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program, without any locking point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual for & kaudiocreator; it is intended. whoever wants to add or change something useful, may do it. at least only after making contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing to this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file from the & kde; SVN, you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karajan game of & kde; besides others, it has a real-time graphics and karaoke-real-time highlighting of texts also some features that others & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is involved as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (lyrics or text events). kmid automatically detects the procedure used each time.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you want to quit while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open it... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -windows in the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the Edit menu or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving with the knob back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the left and right of the template and change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar affects the space bar as a pressure on the Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the piece, interrupts the playback. pressing the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use texture, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event is automatically determined using a song, so you don't have to manually adjust anything. so if you select the automatic text selection entry in the Settings menu, the Karaoke text will be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select from the Settings menu the entries text events or song events. the same function also have buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager first. you can find it in the menu Collection under the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each item in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is enabled and emptied. this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the turn from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To skip a song, select the previous piece, the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & cmid; it is not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General-Midi-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always allows a trumpet to be heard when a piano was originally supposed to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the precondition for this is that each occurrence has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "An additional keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the word drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc.), and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always equal drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as are its presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to depict sounds on the percussion channel. take a look, for example, the included Keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to replace the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on that channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch benefit event with the value n, this is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard, which gets a pitch benefit event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes higher up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, Item MIDI Settings menu</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI-channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen when you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; Desktop an & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; open on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, turn off automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the automatic addition to the collection and open up A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this inspires me, further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; however, before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I therefore want to emphasize that I only keep programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Revival of the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful mic and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; can also be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search information and see pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear music of course.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files that are supported by MPlayer or Phonon formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished than & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Definitive Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level. when you select an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current play ', TV and persistent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can do this only if & KMPlayer; you can also choose the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / app. simply click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlist from the Edit menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when you leave edit mode or select another group without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by modifying the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end of the animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the displaying of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; img dur = "in." src = "file: / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; / bodies; & lt; / bodies; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file, just like installing the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even include the special embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash must be specified in the Setup dialog File Associations of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, check the Backend output inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given backend for a specific mime-type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the code to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support can only use XVideo, XVideo should work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension needs to be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, this dvdnavel, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource are used by KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint as to how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command can be run as root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why must my CPU be tested for its performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1749">To learn more about & Posters; and its possibilities to experience, the manual should be used to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct output: hold-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a layman (englishlay) & latex; -Makros. a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here is just a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to be able to rule correctly, good books, such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages, & latex; an introduction with which the general characteristics like paper format, page numbering and text formats are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Assistant by & Kile; is a useful feature for speedy creation of a document in & Kile; selecting the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some options for the creation of the document. some settings can also be made to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is used to obtain the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], Brief [report], Article (DIN) [scrartcl], Articles (DIN) [scrreprt], Book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [projector], film [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as default. at best UTF-8X should be used (for the correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for integration only have to be washed in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), a book (DIN), a report (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN provisions). they should always be used in the creation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about this. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source text editors - the emphasis on the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unmatched ones). by & Kile; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is quite probable that some mathematical surrounding is not closed. however, you'll notice it by the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save time and enhancements through the highlighting time.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic execution of the environments, by entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically create a blank line (for input of the text) and the added line to the command of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu Settings box; LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the most important and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective icon.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file [executable file) was created, navigating & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the common output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the map search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as it was clicked on an element in the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it. the preview search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as you clicked on a paragraph in the & latex; source code, the corresponding link is entered in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other integrated .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master-document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no bugs in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is installed on the 'internal' and there is no call from & Okular; after quick-fitting.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, you should see the three large selection fields. the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for rapid integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box For further information is available for items such as keywords, filling notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (choice over a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; -files may also be written in & box; manually written.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ mane is used for the definition of font sizes. it can be used to specify the font sizes for the main text, the seam marks, etc. there are the following fonts to be available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & box, there are two options available: 1. the wizard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The braces after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the push button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; records storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors in the recording. if it is used with rapid construction & Okular, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size of 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes occur only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold print, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands terminate either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic expression and is active as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be shown recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language is represented, a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & box follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, a quotation, a few places in bold and italics, and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor by editor view or Ctrl E (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed out or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (provided the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar permits the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion to desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-selection enables the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only Modern can be set up in Settings box... Construction tools must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pre-selection search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on pre-select search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; viewer is then performed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okular; set as text editor (settings eyepieces set up... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should a mistake occur when using Fasting the & DVI; a bug may exist. if a bug is available, this will be summarised in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file lists the sources of error in the source code. in the editor you can use the buttons of the LaTeX error and the LaTeX error for jumps between the errors. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error should be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, please see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Most commonly used users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document using File New, some strings are replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... Settings General set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can create your own template instead of the standard features.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; -files. if a simple way to create a template, you should search for a template on the Internet and use the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& box; used & Posters; as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more, and its opportunities to experience, the manual should be used to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via the menue LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex, and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the '\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight different kinds of source texts. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many Wizard can enter additional jumping marks. it is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit jumping marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump mark is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; though & Posters; already outstanding features have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -Source text added. & latex; specifies always many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, as this command also selects & latex; -commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, this can be cut first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Pounds; offers the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to edit a paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile provides; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is injected at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command we jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is injected at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded brackets.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the weighted clip of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of nested curly braces can be lost quickly the overview over. this command includes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two easy note signs are used as GÃ ¼ nÃ ¼ sschen. for the practical implementation it is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple note signs is used. also for the end of the transfer the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and adds two exclusive license plates for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double lock token can be set under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Foreign language settings (e.g. ngerman or French) can also be used in foreign languages. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting shift; enter key & kick; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table -environment lock & box; the current line with\\\\ with an enclosed line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings box; Set up LaTeX.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already having a good source code completion, this has been added to & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set for different working modes under Settings box... fully set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment by means of the\\ begin {surrounding} will & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surrounding} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and, as a result, the complete list can be graded. on the other hand, the list can also be scaled down by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jumping tokens may be frozen, so that a simple jump to these positions means possible jumping tokens and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. you can choose different lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rters of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the full-space invocation will result in a large e list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-space change over the Mentioned environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the fake in & GUI; -elements can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a new part, we start editing with the Edit Plugins menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location, & quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & Quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves as a unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (her identity) appears greasy after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and attitudes of one's own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for more information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event for information can be made to team leaders when something certain happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project, so that later you can see how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that will insert a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project Project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees chosen in the recipient list. address sat can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from ordinary comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">There can be either the comment entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, has a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around brackets and: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& Quantaplus; is a development environment for script- and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus. -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using settings Quanta. this dialog stretches over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus, with regard to tags, including car complete, can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Size / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal / lowercase, the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attribute. normal / lowercase signifies that attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end-day automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the button standard, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in a different way as file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis, so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documenting can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a box), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is perplexed by modifying the MDI modes and / or dependencies of views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behaviour of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep is to be opened automatically when changing the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting shortcuts (some kind of templates) that can be deployed when editing too large text. abbreviations are grouped into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifconfig abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, at the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not located at a standar like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plugin refuses to load the load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select enables saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & Quantaplus, as of version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead of this, a debugger-Plugin concept was implemented, which allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, which adds support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & Quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. appears normally in the left corner.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. appears normally in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a debugger so that normally it doesn't have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to send a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without informing the variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution proceeds. if a debug is given, execution starts as soon as a request is asked.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible, if possible in functions and include, will be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there is no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front-end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adjust & quantaplus, to your needs and how you can & quantaplus; help you get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus, to provide support for Markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS. they allow & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and & CSS; s. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbolic bodies of image buttons (above the editing pane), insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see details for conversion details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Tagging XML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Properties dialog, the & quantaplus, for the day. descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a typing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the type method. specify the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Specifies an attribute of a tag. this element can only exist once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags describing how to display this attribute & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus. is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus, is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a chipping and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagName%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that summarizes the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of items that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that terminate a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but watch & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; will not cause leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus. to start and select TagXML. dialog box. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagging file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tagging file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "UTF-8" &gt; &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnaround = "function =" class _ name "type =" optional "/ &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, attainable via DTD Edite DTD settings. this can be edited by Ediedescriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; with the following entries are created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Use 1 for & Quantaplus; Version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created with Settings actions... created. click New Action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut shortcut for this action. clicking the user defined button can be assigned a shortcut; with Keiner, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & Quantaplus, themselves are the Schnellstart -Dialog or the various Lo... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir directive in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / share / apps / Quanta / scripts local scripting folder: $PATH / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & Quantaplus. if only one instance is running the text will be added unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script may receive input from & quantaplus. in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the exported application can also be rerouted. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the default output. it can be specified what to do with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output drop-down menu:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you have to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable" "" "Edit day" "" "dialog when available so that an input when using the action is possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Visual other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this icon will start; start; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions set... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators into multiple groups.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I'll select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable addition of & quantaplus; for the normal user there is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in the & Quantaplus. repository if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # items in the main index Top Element = &gt; Section1.html sections 2 = Section1.html sections 2 = Section1.html sections 2 = Section1.html sections 2 = Section1.html tag 1 = tag1.html tag 3 = tag1.html tag 3 = tag1.html tag 3 = tag1.html tag 3 = tag 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see in the & PHP manual page now:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but watch & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to design context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is indicated. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file attachment lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc by $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantaplus. they will not be rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at various points there is an Email-sending menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), send by email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make an adult's contribution, we recommend signing the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can search for one.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signalling. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages which are not currently supported by & Quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagging XML. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that should appear in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion to the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In order to understand and gain full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first acquaint themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain these concepts precisely to them, without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & Quantaplus, the division is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars about actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user folder, so that it can only be used by this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which embeds the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & Quantaplus, -MDI; consists of a number of main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and toolbars. please go in, and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the map frontrunner with the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all flashers, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area will lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tag under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. as part of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialogue with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Tree Consibilities (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & Quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & Quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & Quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the categories are always available, local templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project will also work here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh of the tree will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manly attributes and namespaces can change. the entry system geared to the content enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus, by the quantaplus. 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus has; two flashbacks at the bottom of the window to be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & Quantaplus; -Scripts which are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & Quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive by & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & Quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus, now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus, for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework is not only this possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Quantaplus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation can be found with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look in the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; enrolment so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard to & URL; enrolment which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script prints error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scriptions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus. main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & Quantaplus, Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project Dir / Toolbars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by setting actions.... toolbars are saved using toolbar toolbars or you will be asked when you exit, whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & Quantaplus, team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to & quantaplus, own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent integration means that & quantaplus; inserting tool bar is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click it. click on a activated plugins turn off.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the one; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which matches the display in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus. Main Window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & Posters; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate help in line with the mouse pointer environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& Quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in a financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be automatically completed. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you handle local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-server scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, etc.) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Note that if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub-window profiles or changed using the Shift-F7 button.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project opens, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload profiles can be uploaded to profile sections (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by putting a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-specified event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, open & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the Project menu or the Symbol project opens from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows you to select a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & Quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & Quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are opened and opened with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only more one profile, the button will be dazzled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten with Programing. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk storage option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & Quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time saving function or a risk. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply deleting the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best managed using the toolbar menu. usage and addition differ. the addition of toolbars is discussed at the bottom of the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions like toolbar can be removed, toolbars can be rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be indicated in the dialog, where actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files for linking. & Quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with expanded organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some of them with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary patterns are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are placed in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area is to be inserted again and again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save as local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or insert via the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file, you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template to create and secure a name for the template. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can submit headers and footers or connect dynamically to & PHP; design, insert files or link them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as elteristic attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list. if a root folder is set to such a way, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you'll probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preprogrammed or imprinted text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (click on it, press the right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second editor shares the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source editor if needed, where the changes made in the VPL; Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. PHP is still the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active, this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; view you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for quick calculators and a large margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select tools for document properties. it is also possible to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of looking out pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor is strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a feedback button or a distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it is important to note that inserting tags before inserting tags is not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding armature day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables assistant or the Listen Assistent are disabled. they will later work in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheets can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3; let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the modified lines, but I could not see exactly what was changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, just copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">One function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the merge-editor between the differences windows allows the resolution of conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files while merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and mimics the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to frequently check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance when someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder folder folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folders folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will open your selection and will display it next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration dialog opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start merging / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, upload them to & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot remove anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse take a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is activated, the line will be scored at broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the output output:, the file name and [changes] if you edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe button to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summation column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also indicate a jump of position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignoring the options numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the dispensing window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. by inserting the Insert key, you can switch between insertion and overwriting mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture Abwards) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark into the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is checked, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful, because you could accidentally overwrite the clipboard content.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32 based systems use cart return + newline drive\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps track of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start. (menu Setting &gt; &gt; KF3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italic font will be displayed. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be displayed astert. on these systems, the button presets automatically displays an unaltered color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, when the tab key is pressed, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard will then be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all of the identical rows in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored. also when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while other files with different sizes are identical in page-to-page comparison though they are different.</seg>
<seg id="2331">This option is deactivated in default. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated in default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">This setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unsolved conflict is passed on.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Removes automatic all conflicts in white marks using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge. look for details in the documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must quit & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding a short notice is displayed, which is local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress uplifting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply delete the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge operation and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example, to cut out annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal processor command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessor command for line truncation to convert input into uppercase: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is a graceful expression that matches all characters in one line.\\ 1 in the replace string refers to the found text in the first clip. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KRC3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e 's / Rep / Ertags / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be maintained for displaying and merging. further operations only change the data that the newline algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the newprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the merge and merging of single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, Folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the folder scanning, only the files that have been compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that has been found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merging operation cannot be chosen automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colours A / B / C use the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, for identical entries the colour is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. at folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is green only, then becomes yellow and later when it is old red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then investigate & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, a file is processed after the other. it status column shows ready when merging is successful, and other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is alright all over.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KF3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. once you have selected all the merging actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you haven't specified a destination folder, then in the three folder merging mode C is used as the target, B is chosen as the target while synchronizing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options to skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only select the current entry: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options permissions, simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, an appropriate dialog appears. then execute & kdiff3; its work with the next entry will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that should help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, it notes & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and does not merge them at the later merging of all entries. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KF3 set up...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When left to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the links are compared to normal folders and searches recursively. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3;) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders across a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the revision date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. the results from the merge of files are stored in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is regarded as unsafe, because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge views always remain visible to merging individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch off the option directory & text window and switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder. once you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder association.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you re-read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. it is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished by showing a link to a file or folder. then, a file is always accepted as a link object. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or the date of change deviate from the original. (please refer to the option Trust of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part display from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; at least one of the two files must exist. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch file to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and choose from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compare) already exist. furthermore, the name KRC3 already points out that it can run together like the program diff3 from the Diff-Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by taking a look at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc).</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is not treated as identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has so far been too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit greater amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a & kde system; to compile and install, use the following command in the base Folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, refer to the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umbrated Remove) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current cursor position.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program you need to re-read the folder with the Refresh feature after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displaying the differences. this also leads to the fact that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain those files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C font below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual worktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual worktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a working surface and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries to set up... and exit. however, if an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize, maximise, on desktop and exit. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, Windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field to indicate the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual worktops. if it is enabled together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this box is ticked, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the & Kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this box is ticked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with their default icon and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as is known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual work surfaces are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very well suited for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager MiniProgram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch settings... let the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vid. if you don't have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or login to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions. it is optimized for use on performance-sensitive machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as selection box below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a moving loupe. alternatively, you can set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop-down mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is shown in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the Shift; Shift or the & MMB; use it, you can move the drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the display update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode a selection window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen saver. you can magnify an area of the screen, as if you use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer resets for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the petitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain that arises when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also be caused by the mere desire of the mouse. if you suffer from pain related to your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift activated, power & kmousetool; a pause after it emulated pressing the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way you can pull the drag with pressed mouse button. the intelligent sliding requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button waits before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function activates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; to speed the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a sliders sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; this feature is currently only available under & kde; please consult the documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to automatically launch a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Resets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last press is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, first with presets. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be switched off at first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later shift the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick in doing so is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can be easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent shift in this case, this means that the operation is no longer possible by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool, under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. but you can park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to copy and paste text into the clipboard or run any other action where you want to move the mouse over with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it. instead, highlight text as follows: at the end of the text area, select a mouse click and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and clicking the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is done every time, when & kmousetool, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shifting time begins. later you can use the smart move without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest-extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor arrives. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome who have pain in the mouth of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that a certain time is waiting for a pulling action before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand how filtering works, it is important to know how the" "" "speech-dispatcher" "" "program works with a text." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read before, the retained orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message cancels normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you are reading & eg; reading a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; anyone who just enters the room. & kde; -Notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every job you govern orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader while & ktts; just one such reads, this output is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character placers replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with predefined string box filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a more understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Converter uses an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of supply of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; for example, if you have set a female voice on the speakers card, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, he continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a message; -notification is sent to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting of string replacement filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it must only differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Create. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The 'speech-dispatcher' program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizer. if you want to expand, use another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile it, you need a new development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the kdelibs package and the developer files for the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code of & ktts; from the source code archive for pasting or downloaded the tarball each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, check first if speech-dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first copy of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can go back, repeat, pause, or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it is used, otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen. if you want to know more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to Add to add a speaker to the list, or click Edit, the speaker device is displayed. for example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. details on the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival in PATH is included, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival. in the case of voices, the & ktts; this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages like ISO 8859-1 are used, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These sliding controls allow you to adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey, the voice you choose will not allow you to adjust these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices require several seconds to load due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window of kttsmgr will be displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start only the icon ktmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the standard voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the configuration for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100%, SSML is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this lets & ktts; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">In the first start of & ktts, a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add more set filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker is to try it. switch off the speakers selection and select text to read. switch on the speakers selection again, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you need to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading faster, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel orders on the card map, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal slider recognition filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tablature sign (decimal code 8) at the set limits. (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before the filter). note that the default trace element recognition filter keeps the set setting.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never applied to & kde; messages (kronnotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal sentence recognition filter by default, you can paste it again by uploading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection list, you can overwrite the speaker settings for the application. the card map is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card speaker). in other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the features of a set subscriber. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & mark; otherwise select & tracts; designate the speaker closest to the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should take precedence over other properties.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker button and then use speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before using & ktts; check first if your language synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported. with many voices, you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts;</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help is found in the instructions provided with the Festival. if you want to read websites, you must install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software into festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you have to type in the voice MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a cyrillic (8 bit) coding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions. therefore, look for Festival as first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the code must be set up to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding must be set to an 8 bit Cyrillic, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA; synthesizer. then, festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -votes can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete voice output system. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. festival generates this by & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also generate Diphone from German lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process additional wrapper code is added to festival to use & MBROLA; -Voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files are not installed in the & MBROLA; -folder, but in the folder festival / lib /. instructions can be found at</seg>

<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; any voice synthesizer located in a console; can be controlled from the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; a module for the & kcontrolcenter; this allows managing network interfaces, routing, and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network configuration module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded if the network settings option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; -index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the Releasestand. by marking the setting non-again, the definition can be permanently taken.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning that the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can enter system administration mode at the right bottom end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The setting of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... Setting up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection automatical, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be done. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. you can determine if the desired address is already in use. if in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on as required. switch on an off-off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched on as required. switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host on the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain input by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine http: / / www.enedomain.org requests, DNS picks up this name to an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution system allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry or descending or descending into the list with the buttons Hinauf or Herunter in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group host to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the Add Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to the name resolution, select one entry and then click on the Edit... button will be shown in the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Name-to-IP address references for TCP / IP subsystem. first and foremost, it is used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of name-known calculators contains some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP will replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known calculator and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has multiple alias names, press Enter several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry from a name known to name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit your machine will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes must be set in a & Console; the following command is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, and in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changes in configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point that applies a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 PCs.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.045; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address is 127.0.0.1 assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if a different content is found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar that provided the Ability of dds2tar for fast, selective zipping. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be bound by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; do the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. don't recognize & kdat; don't see the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preview, searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by a change in the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type needs to be formatted before you can use data to store data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape needs to be formatted before using, this must happen before you can format the tape from & kdat; floppy tape drives usually require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not require formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; continuing with formatting the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before hitting the backup, you need to select the files to be secured. it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be saved.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives using a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select" "" "Restore" "" "in the File menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band indexfile on the basis of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located in the same file system will be backed up, such as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; & lt; files were not fully implemented at the time the documentation was created.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmited & kdat; before the tape is bound, the command blows load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the spin at the tape drive. possibly this setting will not work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, loosening the integration of & kdat; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; change the hardware-size block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formats, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only record a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different log files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users quick access to information about problems occurring on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; features that allow the individual protocol lines to be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - open. if this is not shown, and it opens itself instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system management privileges. the protocol files usually find themselves under Linux in the / var / log directory, for which normal users usually have no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or set string. enter a string into the filter bar. the list of log lines is now automatically displayed, so that only log lines are displayed. in the default setting, the selection box contains the entry All. then a log line is displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. in addition, in the Log File System Protocol, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filterbar; all log lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important log lines. speed lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as minutes lines of step critic. the color representation of minutes rows can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identifier (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can switch the option to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display several log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You will find more current information about the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and named so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the Linux; world. and, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you want to start when starting the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for the init in different places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you come to fix it by rebooting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; one server running level that only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Running and change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The number of entries in the entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the Sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another level, move it to the clipboard with cut-out (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired rank level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or name of an item manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runlevels, and now the machine is constantly starting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for running Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions but is unfortunately not standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg, Apache or httpd) simply end without news if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly configured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the Runlevel so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaption of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save file in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group by double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have set advanced system settings. only if you have activated space restrictions (Quota) for users, a card card is created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card menu appears, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if a filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system with wildcard restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you will find in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The batch dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove, and change the boot password, change the time to the boot of the default operation system, remove the default operation system, remove, change, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
