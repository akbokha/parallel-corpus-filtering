although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top German court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only reinforced by my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , its diversity so inviting is that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that records people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
the Tru@@ mp Welt@@ anschau@@ ung , too , did not agree with the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp made his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , made the presi@@ dency a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those acting and thinking in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control over a country that they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WC ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash play on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big van Jones described , has just killed what America made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mps , a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the music that is played in both places not only has changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s community in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ den violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments very seriously to the music group , the local press says Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they return home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers led by F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
at first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments made of re@@ manufactured material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and less inclined to welcome a criminal of this type on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobil@@ ising themselves against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at his time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia , for pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which cris@@ sc@@ ros@@ ses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the NGO stop Il@@ legal Fishing .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , which is extremely difficult to track . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now happening in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious cycling routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is loading his caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal code .
on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can refuse to accept such vessels in their ports , which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD lost in lost revenue which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network loose each year because of illegal f@@ ishers who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among them also illegal fishing fishermen .
their practices include , among others , actions like sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , ph@@ anta@@ si@@ en@@ ames , fish protected species and fishing in conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot stop my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found refuge ships .
based on his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international crime against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal f@@ ishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine &amp; Marine Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each tracking vessel can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evidence that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and had little to expect with consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use was prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a vessel travelling under false flag , was on the way without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the ocean .

her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ ain@@ ing the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the application of the opposition to a deportation order , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the rec@@ er@@ tification of Venezuela ) can be seen both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central North @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with acute defici@@ encies in food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and profitability are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Party ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , the prot@@ esters called for a majority of representatives of the opposition on October 27 . here , the process against President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro was planned .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the frame of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .

on Twitter there are pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves struck the news on police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear coats because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already opens the round which forms the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial commission - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ tion !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , did not take action against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and have preferred to refrain from breaking critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z and Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified in the context of the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship have been investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that this was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the Commander of the Intelligence Department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made yourself friends with one of the ERP .
just watch out that they will not ent@@ ail you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok , because so my father had educated me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers belonging to the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a lie that people were tortured .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just tied there .
they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the smell there was horrible ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for someone else to suffer so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were tied up with hands and feet .
near the entrance , people stood quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to the testim@@ onies given by the Civil War Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was sentenced to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look on the map , you see that they took approximately this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they were to be la@@ yed .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; A@@ war@@ ts &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time , at the age of age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military - I was in gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war du@@ des are a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military signs , which one removes an enemy you have fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , record player , clothing , painting , money ... it is not a war effort but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who are driving cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you independently .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families to hand over their mort@@ al rem@@ nants ?
the disappearance of corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and somewhere dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i have seen you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie himself .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ gations about all the cru@@ el@@ ty that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly ki@@ cked off and asked myself why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they claimed were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then cried I :
how can you tell me something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I got the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping under a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the Jud@@ gments in the Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended up in August 1975 because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims .
43 Cri@@ mes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court suspended life sentences and in nine cases prison sentences were between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pi@@ ero De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for this took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors make older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with translation errors at a center in Kyoto , in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
works by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto &apos;s Japanese city , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , witnessed a very dis@@ satisfied translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word is being translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a Ky@@ ot@@ os resident . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gramm@@ atically not correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported on the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are truly sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked about the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an inadequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are involved nationwide in accidents , is definitely cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by the elderly has risen in the same period .
the named re@@ porter in the article published on Yahoo revealed comments to the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the belief that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
in this way , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could translate into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ making or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees , can still make translations into their company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are best rated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the phrases and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more thorough translation can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also transmitted photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups that resist the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the tasks of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was tied , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
that is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ play@@ Net .
offerings such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ tians with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ ot@@ tro later confirmed that not only vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online tran@@ smit@@ ters . this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds faulty or denied the request when calling a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was detained .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in custody .
eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ a as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects evidence of other crimes against Cri@@ mean , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by cur@@ ricul@@ ums published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ liegende cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family she lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ a for the family . as a cri@@ adi@@ ta in Paraguay there are more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their minor son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , an education and a roof above the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation struggling for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ k@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which cri@@ mp@@ ed to the cri@@ p@@ ta guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
there is , on the one hand , the family who in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households has been seen as a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent sho@@ cks . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n as long as it suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers but also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register course and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in her employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never had to star@@ ve , but did not have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would speak their mother tongue Guar@@ ani again at home .

however , she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken is mo@@ bbing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ a@@ tas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ p@@ ta .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
Hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the town Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the publisher of the ad switched off again :
dear friends , I found one . I wonder if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ min@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ ) and the indigenous population had to pay tribute to them , and the system of the Mens@@ Ãº ( in which the workers are regarded as semi @-@ slaves ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
Pix@@ ab@@ ay , edited by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted on a draft bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulate the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by the Parliament , users must register with a government authority in Egypt to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video message and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration to the users . it is also unclear how to identify those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP @-@ design@@ ate and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Communications and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but until now it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Engine@@ ers &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees , before it goes to plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest .
how a Kurdish natural guard protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war marked by war

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species belonging to the greater family of le@@ op@@ ards wandering through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a enjoys a passion for another side of her country , which is not just about war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting up protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region .

in early March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the northeast of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had spark@@ ed the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast pre@@ f@@ ecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighboring coun@@ c@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture underwent an atomic accident , alone that alone 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local communities .

housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated of housing shel@@ ters ( from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) will be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this process . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees who were living after disaster in shel@@ ters were evacu@@ ated to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by un@@ happiness have opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been extensively affected .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear lock zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her feelings were changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the indigenous population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed found that still not enough was done in matters of disaster prevention .
as it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan has ever witnessed .
of 160@@ ,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 thousand people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , slightly more than 23@@ ,000 people were transferred back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees still living in shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often notices that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we address topics that get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer fought against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread itself rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the incident was completed .
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video filmed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which one sees Mat@@ eus being attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs ha@@ sten to it shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times into social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father because he has sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here a occupied school with a gas leak was sab@@ ot@@ aged . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stroke .
police traffic gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where last Friday , brutal police operations against prot@@ esters arrived .
polic@@ emen were protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to for@@ ego violence against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers nationwide .
once again , the Brazilian media have mess@@ ed up street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected prot@@ agonist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window , illustr@@ ating their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a particular cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
villages forgotten by de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Act , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba followed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich &apos;s municipality , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on the spot .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after succ@@ um@@ bing the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation again after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane plant , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are already no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway section of the municipality has already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were out@@ dated technically , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they only left the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound must remain , according to the 2016 Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated the most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially recorded documents , which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts which would be removed , the address and date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was passed and the letters became more and more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the appointed factory for two years and he was one who received his letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the most highly developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important work bench has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that were generated by the plants in which they were located .
we will never know whether during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had been no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory concluded , or rather , when they began to deter them , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were used to spare parts .
without a perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , nevertheless he does not forgive the lies you told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene is in retirement at age 65 , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been teaching mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Star .
the workshop thus increases that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the kite bu@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a stretch of road in western Canada , on which almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalization , is important .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day that you will take our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward just as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary box , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic courts ( at the top of the page ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small businesses producing the plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even catch them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phones decorated with plastic courts as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collectors items , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an ka@@ ze @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was converted into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # als .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the section of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug abuse such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the drug trade &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret tom@@ bs for his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a lady of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book on crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin is thinking that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals st@@ ole money from their business month by month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you are thinking about everything you &apos;ve lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and that he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor numbered 33@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killing per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; in 2015 , Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which he links contain pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has sur@@ faced the first time ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater that was full of people watching the football world championship .
houses burned and char@@ med corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to shame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an image titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ More photos of the incident show the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been pla@@ gu@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses were dr@@ astically reported by atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted bil@@ l@@ ly .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged , as wrong@@ ly proved as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of ab@@ uses ; Africa Check has documented affili@@ ations to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
another step further on personal comments such as this example mistakenly shows the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the photograph from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this image comes from an Saudi news site , wrong@@ ly asser@@ ting in 2012 , the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein have said that monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to make this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , were wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein &apos;s statement , but had not associated the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings go back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information crosses borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private sites , social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have incorporated some examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published on which side they were published . thus , we want to illustrate the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were linked together ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases which can be sc@@ aled up now ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available .
the gray countries are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ y@@ Eye , are likely to present examples of fal@@ si@@ fication .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy of the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to off@@ end the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a rec@@ tification on what it meant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally dark news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in respect to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims s@@ lay Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein landed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the image is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the catho@@ lic nearby message site An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ ferti@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the image of the DR Congo emerged with this Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were paying greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message which was supposedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the message contained in the image from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated himself .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .

( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original date of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Images
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions on the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are dozens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water surrounding a tragedy .
does this sen@@ timent suggest wrong and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ate the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equal to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images may des@@ en@@ si@@ tise readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner .
however , every investigation of incorrect attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ passed words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ sla@@ p language by Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ e around your parents in recognition of their efforts in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ eses language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - Comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun during cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , who are very much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite fe@@ ats here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the Sri L@@ ank@@ an cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ er centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge la@@ ths .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected by Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 30@@ 4 safe places .
the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ w@@ ang City with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flight mer@@ ges the Den@@ gue fever , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ all is already on its way .
this morning the N@@ hat@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the wat@@ cht@@ ower of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are made for the transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks worried people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ax@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents into security and provide assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now on the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I participated at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust ye my four year old daughter ; she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one we &apos;ll get rights for Trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , isn &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in its conception .
they had to lim@@ b me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim pi@@ geon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in there , are m@@ ashed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reli@@ efs to be reli@@ ed
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace of mind ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this dele@@ tion makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been coloni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist , Edward S@@ aid , sh@@ attered the story behind these images .
but these pictures rise still today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to for@@ tify them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I saw how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rations dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality of nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong s@@ cars weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and fla@@ wed our collective imagination that Si@@ kh men and children will often become the target of anti @-@ tim@@ eli@@ tist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion are part
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America in the highest degree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ born Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants originating from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan reas@@ oned the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were free Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or carrying out my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ist machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information , which has been manipul@@ ated by our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ scar@@ f .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter , if I held her in my arms and let her take the Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal with their sisters ; as they have decades ago gained a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means is my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was coloni@@ zed by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ or Bri@@ tische Eastern ini@@ di@@ ums @-@ Company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an irre@@ voc@@ ably wept for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not include in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mere submission of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion are deeply rooted in our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed over every continent aside from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects carry a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call for prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that a African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion hides more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islamic hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely focuses Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we run and the bombs which we throw off to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply advised to abst@@ ain from the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous im@@ prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news agencies .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # good@@ will of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multiply Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IST , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ miss@@ able Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation takes place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hos@@ tility .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not the terms we usually take in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being w@@ aged and people were en@@ umer@@ ated by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation four decades ago was even scientific at Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake feeds , while he has already broken lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling aims to preserve urban diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS already has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project apply :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - secure spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often related to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreci@@ ating , feeling , soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers start their history in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience takes care of it .
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer has a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story that is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened !
they were alert ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to arrange their own story@@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico calls on the USA to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which started on 3 April 2017 . the march launched at the Republi@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials who are responsible for the debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audi@@ ting and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .

the island - not in the sovereign territory of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
that is why the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event in the # Free@@ BS@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , produced books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( Cost of Freedom : collective research ) .
the book published last year , which is available roy@@ alty free , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make some sense out of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book entitled &quot; Collec@@ tive Memory &quot; gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we opted for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued bass on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the Military Court in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he started working , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish the architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but also of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding them in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a ple@@ a which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I wear with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring all the moments back ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...

and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the rule of violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 , according to Am@@ nesty International &apos;s international human rights organisation .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : accused of corruption , after release , res@@ igned on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
this is the case of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants for the em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ ti@@ als ( around 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Chief San@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ election to the company , which happened on 19th April .
in accordance with an opinion issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who rejected the request , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the firm did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the counter @-@ acting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company seems to remain silent and does not indu@@ ce reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom he had eaten .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
obj@@ ection@@ able !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director no mor@@ ale :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serves to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mak@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mak@@ el and will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as sharp , sing@@ led , and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and was free .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network adopted its posts from the Internet because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still widely discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of eastern Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call attention to hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for purposes of use .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ki@@ cker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will l@@ essen the hate language of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before removing all the posts that are suspected of dissemin@@ ating racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting , and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asks for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefit they had a great turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language but were nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have joined social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks shall also inc@@ ite violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the mono@@ gam@@ y is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 there was a big public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because age , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which tried to abol@@ ish laws for pa@@ edi@@ atric marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader Z. B. had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should be dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children was decided - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country posted on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ sts was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thrilled by the fact that the laws on the children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the pa@@ edi@@ atric marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth nearly every price .
while Abel was of the opinion , it definitely took long enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , stating : , Her@@ vor@@ ossi@@ ping News !
the network has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law said :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the proposal to am@@ end the spouse was adopted today , 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 dep@@ uties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally not permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Chil@@ d@@ par@@ ter@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
thanks to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months ago , Mahar@@ aj has declared his intention to take legal steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be releasing his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act contrary to the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject .
Patricia Favor@@ ite suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in the advantage of them , would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content

for more than a month now Turkey has been blocking its popular cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia as a crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use stra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been carried out since 2007 after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , however , the content can be called off .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what better place for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ ama &apos;s lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was on and I started to snap pictures immediately ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already faced tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book seemed to appear . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ m@@ Ã¡n and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that because of social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a mock trial of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married c@@ ousin with a name .
the tradition of not calling their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have much less justi@@ fications to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main conversation topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage to exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion was about women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands on their names .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they all du@@ ti@@ fully maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband as his name , wanted to try out at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Rou@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projections , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Rou@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of herself throughout the exercise , and another decided to release the entire accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ bing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was frigh@@ tened and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation came out into force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead indicating the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc @-@ red spot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to take care of who they could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ sa @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they did not dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , smu@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini their own couple of kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear it .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will be able to do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only made small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including myself , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at each time on their forehead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving self @-@ confidence to each other , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini states :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .

a new system of ab@@ duction of individuals for organ trafficking , presumably for dis@@ believers , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the Mala@@ wi@@ an border .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently they believed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia stated to the BBC .
it is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , which is the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of individuals of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ AT S@@ ME ashamed A land in which people would have shame to ask for sex against good marks , in which the teachers would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks , and would even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which the people would not or bald or bald @-@ headed for un@@ believers or &quot; black magic &quot; aimed to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida &apos;s Mach@@ ado , a researcher from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and avi@@ d Twitter us@@ her , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of Mor@@ nos@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both sli@@ pper@@ y :

a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ hir &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she was contacted by people who were spending themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ el &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we show that Bass@@ el works as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we acknowledge the efforts of all the people and organisations who have campaig@@ ned for their release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , including the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or enforced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 , in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for the final stage of liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion . &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tells a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to appeal to the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us Release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China since the exports were mostly blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the message that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union .
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , news agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy requests a fur@@ ious response from China , with the foreign ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China to offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to , according to the Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a vote in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to un@@ ra@@ vel the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and the United Kingdom
France &apos;s foreign ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on June 29 :
all the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether or not France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan in the United States
the Council of land@@ fill matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who are campaig@@ ning for peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on June 28 , indicating that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but , according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they were compared with other countries .
it supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that we finally are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old corp@@ se appears again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the distorted logic , since it fits better to its power .
in effect , the answers given to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam about our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system are really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he disgu@@ ised such questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam will take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the reviews that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mistake or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do not defend their city , but not their country ?
who must our Prime Minister pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ur@@ ans ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more about the defence of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked its editors , what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors exposed to certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked most of me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little difference to Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world twenty years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little bra@@ cts on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we clearly say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if one would mistake me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means basically to be industri@@ ous - like the ben@@ ign , soft , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has their own Canadian double @-@ worker ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justi@@ n Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada down@@ right sexy .
Musik@@ video einer Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that is par@@ odi@@ zing the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , in spite of their promise to restore the civil government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the prescri@@ ptions of his girlfriend .
although not expressly political , the music video refers to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video about the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists challenged the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand persi@@ sted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which grants supreme decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in attitudes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons seen by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , supervised by online content and persons accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy , prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a strict attitude towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Maj@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Sun ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in east @-@ west Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ pen@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Sh@@ an @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked on Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and abor@@ tions live in the area .
such settlements are called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ floor apartment blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ek@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nonetheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , serving all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of farm products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative headquarters in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for each child , Nat@@ ascha will receive about $ 9 child benefit .
her husband is working in the mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and h@@ ens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation turns to the end a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for their lives .
they do not know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; accommo@@ dates migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ar base and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , says Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you m@@ ama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if m@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as well as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
on the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users in the entry page .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the City of U@@ rum@@ qi received a phone alert to instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app prevents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities did not want to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat Group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; malicious information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ e &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend on @-@ line and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often associate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which is based on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point at which police inspec@@ tors then checked whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( from the very beginning of the Great Britain section ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council of the party to minim@@ ise the distribution of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and affiliated bodies , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communications equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police until 1 August .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this action viol@@ ates the right of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo GÃ¤@@ a .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dissip@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn apart during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts sought , only my own .
for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not make high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted with silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to assemble .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious image that filled my expectations with full completeness .
at such a moment you are aware that you are releasing the mind from the lamp , but it just isn &apos;t interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only courageous enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his fi@@ du@@ ous eyes set themselves on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really sorry for looking into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause , when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is in my no@@ stri@@ ls until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I walk through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I &apos;m giving all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably assigned me a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and I must immediately set myself without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ ester &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a resp@@ ectable middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness cannot be seen in me any distinctive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that feed on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at that time the cries will sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; playback on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the close visual field of their world view .
this is not a house here that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet with Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions he gli@@ des : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly chat .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er suddenly rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cries .
my cries were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a collector or if that belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them inter@@ changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling down and found no pleasure at all , why he resor@@ ted to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity just f@@ lowed whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect power conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two aw@@ ful hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of speech and opposition
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ lls his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ stained lips .
he lives in the upper@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ u@@ ye@@ e ( for example : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , who opposed the conservative majority and questioned its tried @-@ and @-@ true opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that run from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he won a special dis@@ like against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; second generation Palestinian &quot; - he refers to himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he bl@@ esses two cups of Nes@@ cafÃ© in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the slu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ den of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while drinking water during Ram@@ adan , in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled the performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ du@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to be decided &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply shallow rhetor@@ ic , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ treated traditional gender men by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tro@@ mp@@ ed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust .
over the past few years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; honor mur@@ ders &quot; - un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor mur@@ ders in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner .
according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in jail at an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
even H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from themes that are long as t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was in@@ timi@@ dated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember later that his comments were torn from context , twisted and cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cutting , but it was just a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not contrary to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ h , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom nothing new is that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices were sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association with the reason that they had critical comments on social media comments related to the problems rooted in the deeply rooted corruption .
in view of this , according to H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently also provide resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this report was made possible by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which A@@ man belongs as a Student Fel@@ low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid trucks , the drums and the dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and came from a time when troops mar@@ ched from west Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two trucks are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the view of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external appearance and personal care were rare as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific Ocean coast , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of receiving from bad advice an education in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only secondary school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because out of love for the children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of Love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel pushed out ?
this is exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian milit@@ ants Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , who inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la @-@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters for reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement , forming the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to be able to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhetor@@ ic and carried their arms around the clock , must now resume their lives as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now enter into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to unite and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 Let@@ ters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more .
he continued to tell him , this year , to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response .
the plan was to write letters of hope and support to former F@@ ARC fighters , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would be for@@ given &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set up as they did before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ pos &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life anyone has written me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else of life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger death . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already at war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have explained the history of the organisation , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice turned out from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never been hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to use arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now count on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ isch@@ ova and whose first release took place on the website OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the recent months reporting on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ist compla@@ ining about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community did not come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic at present .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that discussed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , who threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ ects of qu@@ eer men and hiding them in secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a woman of a woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
from childhood she sen@@ sed that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
fear@@ ing for her life , she eventually moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he &apos;d be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you dish@@ on@@ our the family , you junk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in hospital I learned that I had two cut@@ s in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which men or ladies were ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for this I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said I must prove it by going up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ sn@@ y and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for her .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that did not only damage your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a plate sign with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without proof , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; don &apos;t you think you are safe , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I actually try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that there were no people arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not complete a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend tells me that there are not so many .
if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives , to be judged by Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ishing , but deliberately di@@ pped in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote somebody who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even there when these people were taken .
until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ sn@@ y when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually threw us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored lashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short t@@ ops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria never touched me just a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yeah .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
when he became Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
he who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I felt the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily .
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them get ess@@ ences .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ ished flood sor@@ es .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who wish to proph@@ esy to you with foam before the mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have which , the cab@@ inet@@ ans have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life adjustments .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
there has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab ancest@@ ry community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab ancest@@ ry minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have appe@@ aled .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and go for a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government .
Arab ancest@@ ry suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where much of the Arab ancest@@ or community resi@@ des in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and made major efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran in 1925 .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable floor areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to evolve only slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime is systematically den@@ ying Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs workplaces in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy local agriculture and the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k@@ ites rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , ending 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of indigenous ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab ancestors must endure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists * in general .
for example , despite equal education , women are still earning less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still cris@@ sc@@ ros@@ sed by the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple among them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; up@@ lift their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights for all men , all men , and all men at all ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to gender and to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist sphere , which has repeatedly and again rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ners compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical sense is a de@@ hum@@ ani@@ zed and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which in addition absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to completely free myself from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever for us to define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : recur@@ rence : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan Region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , the pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ keepers Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed municipalities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and her tough@@ er fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by the cur@@ ative . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rie@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons concerned .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ husband , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has el@@ ap@@ sed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more .
as another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , the a@@ dep@@ t ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also used nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women pay ad at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all .
contents 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not support anything below 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ ms , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were reported by the District At@@ tor@@ ney General for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads were reported .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since FGM is not an own criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
in August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought that I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana took advantage of social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ically whether he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long and did not leave him sooner .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some kind of complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
their wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against its former partner , who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Easy ) movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees that fem@@ ici@@ des are to be declared an independent off@@ ence and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was modified in some points in order to also win the dep@@ uties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tion was suspended , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had envis@@ aged that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must now bear , if they just provide ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
whoever keeps silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are running away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to allow for such a long time that abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media continues to attack attacks in Oman a year after a newspaper is banned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the prohibited newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year@@ long prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having abol@@ ished his father , Sa@@ Ã¯@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the sole Sultan , he has held positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially domestic intelligence , to limit public freedoms , including press freedom , and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspapers Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of three of their editors , last year , is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its founding in 2007 , corruption in Oman has been reported ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after the newspaper published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS accepted the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ hir &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed for an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was banned in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in front of the court in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , in order to distur@@ b the public order , the abuse of the Internet and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Afghan Ri@@ al ( US $ 7@@ 800 ) . in addition , a one @-@ year prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dissemin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 Afghan Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
however , the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 to serve his six @-@ month prison sentence from the prison prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he served his year@@ long prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again obj@@ ected to the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated press freedom .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ inum and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Afghan authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the government authorities to :
1 . send You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman will be able to exercise their legitimate human rights work freely and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need in the African continent are lacking in the offer of global health care .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being mo@@ vers ourselves .
the solutions we get are often not easy to use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
Q : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are conveyed in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
Q : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and draw@@ backs of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
the system means that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ tent@@ ots , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many kinds of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease , special red or green or cur@@ led leaves .
in recent years , more and more patents have been filed on more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rot varieties . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts on food security care about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still re@@ produces salad , but it now needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there would be a b@@ oul@@ der in which I must yo@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , nobody can breed a new sort of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the USA and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . it is tested there whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US bree@@ der can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ der only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Executive Board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and refers to the ever more frequent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , such as those offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produce vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely distribute their seeds to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the gene pool is shr@@ inking because of the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it difficult for plant breeders to be either not or only difficult to use .
for other plants there are not such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders dec@@ lines by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property owners refriger@@ ate other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent goes on , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow in plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle already .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; generally Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ p , Plant breeders in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as are active in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) possess patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the experim@@ entation or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding vegetable patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies who patent them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one has been protected from competition for 20 years , making it very easy for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading quickly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to maintain the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si commitment cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it appeals against the current practice of the European patent office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the member states to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , declares that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentr@@ ation@@ ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report on food aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has , above all , paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities strongly critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of website lock@@ outs fell victim to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the proliferation of articles and articles that he writes for in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also a native of Canada &apos;s blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a fac@@ ebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the ban on the government and reflected what this means for him :
blocking blogs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi is a priority ; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , a sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blogs , as well as any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence , even if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now after they locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked out 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 2011 . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through the reloc@@ ation of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering information that Egyptian users might have access to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed to court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

day after day newspapers in Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second largest city and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smo@@ kes pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air af@@ air to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , but what happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper in the world with a martial war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
the same video explains a journalist from the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 sites controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it is used ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ ro@@ ates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the Glob@@ o Company , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stresses , repe@@ ats the state &apos;s security policy for years .
among these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a fav@@ ela by employing a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . after several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical for war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian population is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war hin or forth , the fact is that the people of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police rang the hill with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : to learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to wins Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , which led residents to be dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gled food .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional food in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ o Nab@@ il &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; gaining recognition . &quot;
to raise money for the initiative , the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ Do by Monday , 4 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , locally produced fuel are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many capit@@ ol cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which controls the forest areas via satellite images , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Federal Government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have passed since the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging proposal on the forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; says Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ rel in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to expand after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of civil defence from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens searched or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data with the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so critical in October that the servers failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , defe@@ ating the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan was thus a land of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t tell her that way back then she knew that she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
in the dawn , the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly prot@@ rac@@ ted .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many ha@@ ha@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took that which was left of his low salary and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar which were heavier than he himself , to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked .
there was no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that , due to relatively high interest rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions applying asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they have officially submitted an application to asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ pen .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fes@@ pan saved A@@ shar@@ a , soon to free himself from these conditions .
after having worked in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick bite .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afghan @-@ powered companies have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afghan Enter@@ pris@@ er Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail sector , and aim to return to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities too , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; this allows them to sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ne@@ tizen @-@ report : bills of bills from Egypt enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , detained for more than 900 days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that suggests that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority .
users must register to use social networks within six months of the deadline stated on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the payment of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently available to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another MP filed a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties would be imposed for the insul@@ t of the president or a high ranking officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , such action would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for one trial .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed until 20 May , because the prison line , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ants into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , mock @-@ up of amongst others weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza was speaking the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ sad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary free . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating blocking at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an milit@@ ants inter@@ ro@@ gated on uns@@ ett@@ led documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been largely inter@@ ro@@ gated to a consistent action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , as long as they return all un@@ justi@@ fiable funds .
published on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s web site , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined to mention his sources , stating the article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in the district court in Tunis on May 0@@ 9th , he was a witness in the event .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
the rules will also indicate that registration will be required with full real name .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comment@@ aries should be achieved within social networks . until now it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these provisions only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ or of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; disclosure of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was blocked because it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information resource co@@ operated with groups to initiate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey is completely blocked by the website . it is one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
following this week &apos;s backed @-@ up documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased monitoring powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services with regard to the proposal , but has om@@ itted other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until 19 May . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .

we , the members of the Chinese LG@@ BT@@ Q community , stand alongside the victims of the tragedy and their families and loved ones and with all members of the worldwide LG@@ BT@@ Q community .
we mo@@ urn together with them about the loss of so many innocent lives and condemn terrorism , as well as all other forms of violence committed to people on the basis of sexu@@ ality , gender identity and expression of gender . in China , violence occurs on the basis of sexu@@ ality , gender identity and expression of sex every day , such as bul@@ lying by LG@@ BT@@ Q teenagers in schools , discrimin@@ atory treatment and the use of therapies with the aim of &apos; healing &apos; gay and bis@@ exual people .
Blu@@ ed , China &apos;s most popular dating app for homosexu@@ als , changed its loading screen , which now shows the words &quot; we stand with Orlando &quot; ( for example : page on page with Orlando ) .
&quot; the LG@@ BT community is part of the great family of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will win this war through love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the founder of Blu@@ ed on his com@@ bo account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of people assembled on Monday evening in Hong Kong to commemor@@ ate the killed at the assass@@ ination attempt .
