<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top German court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely according to Method Man," "" "I was, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only reinforced by my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, its diversity so inviting is that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that records people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trump Weltanschauung, too, did not agree with the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, made the presidency a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those acting and thinking in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(WC): as much as" "" "white against all other ethnicities" "" "; white and whiplash play on the whites and whiplash, as the big van Jones described, has just killed what America made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps, a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "do Latinos have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "do Afro-Americans have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" from Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places not only has changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for Vicente Guerrero's community in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered young people a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments very seriously to the music group, the local press says Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they return home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers led by Favio Chavez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all produced from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments made of remanufactured material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and less inclined to welcome a criminal of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilising themselves against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at his time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia, for pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crisscrosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NGO stop Illegal Fishing.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, which is extremely difficult to track. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious cycling routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is loading his caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can refuse to accept such vessels in their ports, which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD lost in lost revenue which the eight members of the HISH-i network loose each year because of illegal fishers who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among them also illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among others, actions like sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, phantasienames, fish protected species and fishing in conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "take advantage of the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You cannot stop my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found refuge ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international crime against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine & Marine Organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each tracking vessel can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and had little to expect with consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use was prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become an object of study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a vessel travelling under false flag, was on the way without a license and used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the ocean.

<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the application of the opposition to a deportation order, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recertification of Venezuela) can be seen both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central North-north of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which manifests itself in the daily life of the Venezuelans with acute deficiencies in food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicolás Maduro. in the end, however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and profitability are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Party), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, the protesters called for a majority of representatives of the opposition on October 27. here, the process against President Nicolás Maduro was planned.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday national general strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">"" "the first demonstration in the frame of the action programme" "" "The reconquest of Venezuela" "" "took place on Wednesday, 26 October." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and advocates of the government.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter there are pictures that tell of disputes, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news on police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear coats because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already opens the round which forms the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ministerial commission - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your impetion!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which, from their point of view, did not take action against the disastrous economic crisis and have preferred to refrain from breaking critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez and Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified in the context of the large La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship have been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that this was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmermaid. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was the Commander of the Intelligence Department in La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok, because so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers belonging to the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lumps of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were parked and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open room and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a lie that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="347">In Kyoto's Japanese city, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licence, witnessed a very dissatisfied translation last month.</seg>

<seg id="350">Edited by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a Kyotos resident. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto prefecture apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported on the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are truly sorry that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terribly" "" "was denounced as an inadequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are involved nationwide in accidents, is definitely cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the belief that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could translate into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost-making or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees, can still make translations into their company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are best rated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The phrases and enigmatic sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more thorough translation can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar of Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also transmitted photos of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups that resist the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the tasks of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was tied, and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">That is from the side of @ VivoplayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as vivoplay are popular with the Venetians with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I signed up at @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinottro later confirmed that not only vivoplay was inaccessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds faulty or denied the request when calling a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was stopped on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released, and VPITV went on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates the Internet connections, making it increasingly difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abbreviated version of a report by curriculums published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Fliegende cows, decaying schools"), edited and re-released by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a criadia for the family. as a criadita in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their minor son or their underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange the child receives food, an education and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to spend countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organisation struggling for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crikta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which crimped to the cripta guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family who in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the so far unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households has been seen as a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent shocks. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed a stick to Marín as long as it suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the deep in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," "" "declared Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina Marín could be indicative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as workers but also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register course and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never had to starve, but did not have unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media on the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but did not talk to her." "" "the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn" bad habits "there again." they said that Alvarenga, who belonged to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would speak their mother tongue Guarani again at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">However, she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">"" "Alvarenga was also discriminated at school." "" "one thing about which is almost never spoken is mobbing and the chicans who are exposed to Criatas when they go to school." ""</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cripta.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I didn't have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration to the users. it is also unclear how to identify those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Senior Research Engineers") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>

<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees, before it goes to plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no different narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies belonging to the greater family of leopards wandering through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). all in all, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystems" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza enjoys a passion for another side of her country, which is not just about war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, the northeast of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had sparked the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was one of Japan's Northeast prefecture, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighboring counctures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture underwent an atomic accident, alone that alone 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local communities.</seg>
<seg id="549">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of housing shelters (from the "" "" casetsu juutaku "" "") will be relocated to final replacement houses. "" "</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this process. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who were living after disaster in shelters were evacuated to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by unhappiness have opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">In the three prefectures of agrarian land, the tsunami and the nuclear accident have been extensively affected.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the" "" "nuclear lock zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her feelings were changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed found that still not enough was done in matters of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan has ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 people from Fukushima, nearly 63 thousand people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, slightly more than 23,000 people were transferred back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees still living in shelters are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often notices that one more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we address topics that get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni speaks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a migration has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="593">Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer fought against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the federal university of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread itself rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended from active service until the incident was completed.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers as he strikes at Goiânia with his stroke on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video filmed by Luiz da Luz on the web, in which one sees Mateus being attacked by the police officer and several paramedics hasten to it shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family living in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 Euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police violence. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing has been divided several times into social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heigate Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado invites further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish has been murdered by his father because he has sabotaged the Occupy movement in secondary schools, and here a occupied school with a gas leak was sabotaged. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police traffic grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, where last Friday, brutal police operations against protesters arrived.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had erected a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to forego violence against demonstrators via speaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have messed up street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window, illustrating their title pages illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a particular cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" is absurd, disproportionate, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Villages forgotten by de-industralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso Act, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba followed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalich's municipality, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation again after a long inactive period because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that Mañalich would get the sugar cane plant, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are already no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway section of the municipality has already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were outdated technically, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound must remain, according to the 2016 Report" "" "Agricultural Policy" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated the most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially recorded documents, which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts which would be removed, the address and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was passed and the letters became more and more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the appointed factory for two years and he was one who received his letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he affirmed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most highly developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important work bench has been wiped out.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been teaching mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the kite bukalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a stretch of road in western Canada, on which almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization, is important.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day that you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go forward just as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary box, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"" "to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "" "plastic models of the dishes" "" ") of any food that is served in this restaurant." ""</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small businesses producing the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even catch them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phones decorated with plastic courts as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collectors items, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an kaze-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was converted into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # als.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the section of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug abuse such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, no one looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with the drug trade") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches every weekend secret tombs for his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "where shall we get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who face fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a lady of animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook on criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin is thinking that he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified to be" "" "soaking up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not touched and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was looted with threats." it describes how armed criminals stole money from their business month by month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You are thinking about everything you've lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potatoes, tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and that he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor numbered 33103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killing per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," in 2015, Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country has been neglected and devastated for years. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater that was full of people watching the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charmed corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>

<seg id="831">"" "an image titled" "" "This is Nigeria" "". "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.More photos of the incident show the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been plagued several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses were drastically reported by atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a citizen of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted billly.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged, as wrongly proved as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abuses; Africa Check has documented affiliations to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further on personal comments such as this example mistakenly shows the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The photograph from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations described those who were able to flee, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from an Saudi news site, wrongly asserting in 2012, the President of Myanmar Thein have said that monks and politicians have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to make this information.</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of abusive use of the image from DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet, the sympathy of the Nigerian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger to offend the claims that Rohingya are prosecuted, as the photos were misused.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein landed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the image is still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the catholic nearby message site Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture is not of the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the massacre of the Boko Haram, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorfertiyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world is sleeping).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo emerged with this Twitter hashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities were paying greater attention to these events, presumed in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message which was supposedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, discussion forums such as this were translated into Vietnamese and declared it a false message.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message contained in the image from the DR Congo, the organization of the Claretine Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos dissociated himself.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (gray) also indicates TinyEye, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original date of 2010, the picture may ultimately be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and Images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions on the silence related to the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who inadvertently share the water surrounding a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this sentiment suggest wrong and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and humiliate the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equal to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images may desensitise readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by the context or completely abusive manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every investigation of incorrect attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurpassed words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobmesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwotslap language by Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Bemüe around your parents in recognition of their efforts in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunseses language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - Comfort or laziness that you feel after you have warmed up in the sun during cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish more of these "untranslated" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of Treasure Languages, who are very much appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favourite feats here.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storytelling aims to preserve urban diversity</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unmanageable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS already has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - secure spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often related to understanding" "" "these events are instead" "" "listening to appreciating, feeling, socializing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers start their history in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and representation are leading to the fact that the audience takes care of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer has a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fable of the hare and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to arrange their own storytelling tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">On 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which started on 3 April 2017. the march launched at the Republican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of debt) and the ecumenical assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of refixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "the people of Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, bankers and government officials who are responsible for the debts must be held accountable for their corruption." ""</seg>

<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book published last year, which is available royalty free, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to make some sense out of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Memory" gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police" "" "issued bass on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the Military Court in his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here the Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he started working, the IS would do everything to extinguish the architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but also of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a plea which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the case of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for the embezzlement of 54 million Metials (around 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Chief Sanbaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re-election to the company, which happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion issued by the Attorney General of the Republic, who rejected the request, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the firm did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the counter-acting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"" "" "" "however, the company seems to remain silent and does not induce reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "contrary" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom he had eaten.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Objectionable!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director no morale:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serves to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network adopted its posts from the Internet because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still widely discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of eastern Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "the" "" "(Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call attention to hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for purposes of use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmesan 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebookicker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will lessen the hate language of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before removing all the posts that are suspected of disseminating racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism won't understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "while the action may send a strong signal to everyone that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting, and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asks for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefit they had a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate language but were nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text is" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have joined social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks shall also incite violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016 there was a big public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, because age, age does not determine maturity.

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that between 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which tried to abolish laws for paediatric marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader Z. B. had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should be damned to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children was decided - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained - so that he could be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make it a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law." ""</seg>

<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambresat: the bill against the paediatrists was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled by the fact that the laws on the children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the thing, but do you know what? the paediatric marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth nearly every price.</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law said:</seg>

<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so broadly, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, if we, instead of talking about the problem that the state, that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in the advantage of them, would you be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month now Turkey has been blocking its popular cyclopedia Wikipedia as a crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use strapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been carried out since 2007 after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, however, the content can be called off.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Once we have heard the messages (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we made everything possible to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot access the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiLeror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrors pages when banned in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server continues the query on the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A subecule Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what better place for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gama's lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was on and I started to snap pictures immediately!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know [it], for he had already faced tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book seemed to appear. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take a photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalymán and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that because of social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a mock trial of the Indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married cousin with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not calling their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have much less justifications to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main conversation topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pais has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage to exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion was about women who don't name their husbands on their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they all dutifully maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband as his name, wanted to try out at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rouini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projections, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rouini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of herself throughout the exercise, and another decided to release the entire accumulated frustration against him and his family by curbing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a lot of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was frightened and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation came out into force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead indicating the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc-red spot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to take care of who they could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people it's okay, but some wanted a salsa-kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morals combined with the saris and much more, smuggled Rohini their own couple of kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have only made small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at each time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as haggling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving self-confidence to each other, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini states:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The Beatles' visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>

<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to make the Japanese spin through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here realized quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"" "the music of the cult band is" "" "more than just a universal language like English," "" "said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review." ""</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan. at the age of 51, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of individuals for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelievers, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the Malawian border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs were taken from.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they believed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia stated to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, which is the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of individuals of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Zambézia, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017, in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for the final stage of liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion." after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Lius case as an" "" "internal matter" "" "and tells a speaker that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to appeal to the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius Release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China since the exports were mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the message that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liberate Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "at the same time, we expect China to lift up all the limitations of Mr. Liu's wife and family members." ""</seg>

<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as he can help him in his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, news agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy requests a furious response from China, with the foreign ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told China to offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled to, according to the Chinese constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a vote in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reuters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to unravel the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on June 29:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether or not France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan in the United States</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of landfill matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who are campaigning for peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in a statement on June 28, indicating that many asked him to pray for Liu well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly, as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But, according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they were compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we finally are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of this, it appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old corpse appears again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In effect, the answers given to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam about our press, our judiciary, our political system are really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised such questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam will take the trouble to clarify this point, provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the reviews that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, who makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is correctly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review outlines the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "believed" "" "a mistake or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, statements made by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do not defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our Prime Minister pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and always was a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singapurans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country, above all," "" "etc., but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly with anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't mind.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that is parodizing the Junta, which took power in 2014 and, in spite of their promise to restore the civil government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the prescriptions of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers to the continuing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video about the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Only within the first three days the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists challenged the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand persisted in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "possibly relate to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which grants supreme decision-making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program of" "" "change in attitudes" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons seen by the Junta as critics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose a new unit was set up in the army, supervised by online content and persons accused of being slandered by the monarchy, prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand uses a strict attitude towards" "" "Great Majest" "" "(Majestic Sun)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem case.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in jail, because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillar base and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans speak already on Whatsapp by Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he said, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as well as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">On the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps are to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travelers will always consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">MS Ramírez seems happy to have her house full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she straightens her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair plasters, which she has made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She smiles sad, while she briefly presents her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Ya'se fueron, "she repeats each time." they have gone away. "</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users in the entry page.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi received a phone alert to instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app prevents" "" "preventing access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities did not want to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat Group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "malicious information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwane's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend on-line and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often associate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," which is based on Twitter, published the censored news in China, displayed photos from a checkpoint at which police inspectors then checked whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (from the very beginning of the Great Britain section) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council of the party to minimise the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated bodies, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communications equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police until 1 August.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos," but this action violates the right of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of speech and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he strolls his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the uppermost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as feluyee (for example: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who opposed the conservative majority and questioned its tried-and-true opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that run from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he won a special dislike against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "second generation Palestinian" - he refers to himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he blesses two cups of Nescafé in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slugs speak lukewarm coffee and the Schwaden of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while drinking water during Ramadan, in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled the performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahdub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continue to be decided "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib retreated traditional gender men by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently tromped unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years Jordan has increased the number of "honor murders" - unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honor murders in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in jail at an indefinite period of time," and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from themes that are long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was intimidated," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" "" "Santorano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," "" "get what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to remember later that his comments were torn from context, twisted and censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cutting, but it was just a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not contrary to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuh, who later should work on behalf of the caliphs, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom nothing new is that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices were silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association with the reason that they had critical comments on social media comments related to the problems rooted in the deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, according to Hdaib's opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, streumunitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently also provide resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">"" "this report was made possible by the" "" "Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting" "", "which Aman belongs as a Student Fellow." ""</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the solid trucks, the drums and the dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and came from a time when troops marched from west Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two trucks are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebutafestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "external appearance and personal care were rare as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the barber." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the Pacific Ocean coast, near the historic center of Lima's capital, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these intricate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of receiving from bad advice an education in the hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only secondary school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because out of love for the children, we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel pushed out?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the young Colombian militants Leonardo Párraga from the Bogotá Foundation and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation, who inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la-liación (letters for reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, forming the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians, there is still a long way to be able to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now resume their lives as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to unite and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to tell him, this year, to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The plan was to write letters of hope and support to former FARC fighters, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would be forgiven '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotá Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they did before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," explained the political student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Campos" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he replied," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life anyone has written me something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else of life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger death. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already at war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC have explained the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice turned out from the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never been hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to use arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC now count on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In hospital I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which men or ladies were?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said I must prove it by going up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You brought a monster to the world that did not only damage your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a plate sign with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without proof, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message: "don't you think you are safe, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that there were no people arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not complete a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend tells me that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives, to be judged by Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanishing, but deliberately dipped in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote somebody who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even there when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation have already taken place in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always been wearing my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known all over Grosny when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "civilization" "", "but eventually threw us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored lashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia never touched me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>

<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he became Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who laughed and laughed at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I felt the situation in the republic worsened steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I escort them to the hospital and help them get essences.</seg>

<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body.</seg>

<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jasim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab ancestry community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab ancestry minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have appealed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and go for a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab ancestry suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where much of the Arab ancestor community resides in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and made major efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran in 1925.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable floor areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to evolve only slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is systematically denying Ahwazi-Arabs workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate devastation caused by drought, and to destroy local agriculture and the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawkites rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, ending 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohii, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of indigenous ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab ancestors must endure, human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women are still earning less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still crisscrossed by the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"" "" "" "I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple among them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black Cis women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "uplift their voices" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights for all men, all men, and all men at all; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refers both to gender and to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere, which has repeatedly and again rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourners complained," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in historical sense is a dehumanized and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which in addition absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to completely free myself from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever for us to define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-husband, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has elapsed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman showed Balbuena for abuse, the adept ad of Ada Báez also used nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women pay ad at all, they generally do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>

<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads were reported by the District Attorney General for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of women's ads were reported.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on any woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman who is refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she said at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since FGM is not an own criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana took advantage of social media to report on the mistreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long and did not leave him sooner.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some kind of complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partner, who developed into an impermeable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of its former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Easy) movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees that femicides are to be declared an independent offence and to punish the harsher as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was modified in some points in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortion was suspended, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had envisaged that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must now bear, if they just provide ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been altered, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put to trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having abolished his father, Saïbn Taimur, through a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the sole Sultan, he has held positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially domestic intelligence, to limit public freedoms, including press freedom, and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need in the African continent are lacking in the offer of global health care.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices: what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">What do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being movers ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not easy to use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Q: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are conveyed in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Q: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and drawbacks of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">"" "from the USA to India: how" "" "open source" "" "seed producers change global food production" ""</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredtentots, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work has been limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many kinds of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease, special red or green or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more patents have been filed on more and more plants such as cereals or carrot varieties. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts on food security care about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still reproduces salad, but it now needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there would be a boulder in which I must yodel." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, nobody can breed a new sort of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours to not use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the USA and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salat of the Outredgeous variety in the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station. it is tested there whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeder only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">The professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board Jack Kloppenburg are in control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and refers to the ever more frequent mergers in the global agricultural industry, such as those offered in August and September 2016. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produce vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely distribute their seeds to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the gene pool is shrinking because of the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders to be either not or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders declines by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property owners refrigerate other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent goes on, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow in plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "generally Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant features:" "" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Depp, Plant breeders in the US state Oregon and Ossi Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass-wise herbicides are needed, are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as are active in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) possess patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the experimentation or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"" "Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding vegetable patents:" "" "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies who patent them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent, one has been protected from competition for 20 years, making it very easy for my opinion. "</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship targets in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities strongly criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network due to alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of website lockouts fell victim to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer has access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the proliferation of articles and articles that he writes for inaccessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which is also a native of Canada's blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a facebook comment, Ziada commented on the ban on the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi is a priority; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, a summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles in order to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked out 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 2011. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, which was possible through the relocation of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">"" "" "" "such practice suggests the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering information that Egyptian users might have access to." ""</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed to court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are arguing.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves smokes pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air afair to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published" "" "This is not normal," "" "in which it announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., but what happens to the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the world with a martial war in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">The same video explains a journalist from the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 sites controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it is used?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Morroates per federal state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the Globo Company, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, repeats the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to conquer a favela by employing a massive police force and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. after several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical for war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian population is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War hin or forth, the fact is that the people of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police rang the hill with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to wins Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, which led residents to be dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smuggled food.</seg>

<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>

<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity to fall, if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," says João Sorrel in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to expand after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of civil defence from Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when citizens searched or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so critical in October that the servers failed to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt suddenly protracted.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many hahaara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his flight, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left of his low salary and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar which were heavier than he himself, to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Ashark in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Ashark was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that, due to relatively high interest rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions applying asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre, if they have officially submitted an application to asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharpen.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifespan saved Ashara, soon to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick bite.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the topic of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghan-powered companies have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan Enterpriser Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail sector, and aim to return to the country that he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities too," says Ashark with a smile. "" "" I want to invest in Afghanistan. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and canning techniques. "this allows them to sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that suggests that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of the deadline stated on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>

<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for one trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed until 20 May, because the prison line, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants into the courtroom.</seg>
