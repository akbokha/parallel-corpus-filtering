that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the NSA had heard illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has called upon Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and sp@@ ying journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get that information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had for years indicated that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ordered his telephone calls ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit card , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
amid this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s presum@@ ed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
but just like the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in touch instead of hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that has not yet been given when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than regular mail or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any regular contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot get more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to get off@@ ences . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to report about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers and reports of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague who raises the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider , who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of childhood days , a famous cel@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous waiting for the next release , and on the next uncovered documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a spy or John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these Dis@@ closure is phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these gi@@ ants .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I find it interesting also that there are less reports in the US on this matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who per@@ ished in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a leak of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off especially vulnerable gro@@ o@@ ves .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked all of us that all of us were suggest@@ ing a lawyer to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior complic@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound absurd as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever been changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I can see that some things have begun to change .
in the last couple of years we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has entered central registers on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US hin@@ ders here .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies I made a sales outlet .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me excit@@ edly how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him first ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , slept on tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs in his classroom today . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners were actually friends who only waited for being discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform anxiety into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and established such &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I gaz@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former co @-@ worker , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite other people to stay overnight .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is yet wholly at ease would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aimed at .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
put your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this silent touch of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is the way most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ?
could you please tell us Twitter that he is candidates for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told how to come from , how does his dog or his children mean ?
imagine you had 150 ratings , all of them say : &quot; he can really stick to very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system will strengthen confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their jud@@ gements before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most that are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it gets exciting when you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing will change .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation weak@@ ens com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from it .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re told too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; say too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there &apos;s an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;ll be on vacation with my family . &quot;
how can you design it with design to make this level of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ lawful parties or rav@@ aged dwell@@ ings .
hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think of it .
the disappointment you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , 123 million overnight stays were only a fraction of a problem .
for men have trusted one another .
if trust works , wonderful things can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks because of se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books .
they can even stay longer without charging extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is going on .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about economic trade here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply not to call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy is describing a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait for a group there to fill a thoroughly and show you at a pub craw@@ l , of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ator programs have been started ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . on our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries alone will be guest at a stranger or even a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
aside from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had such a big impact , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the airport &apos;s safety check .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do that .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later , I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... ... Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember as I ro@@ de in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lit territories , &quot; &quot; Get you not . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims to be free and struck .
there were really fire@@ places on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to be self @-@ expla@@ in@@ able .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : you remove a malign@@ ant tumor as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ear@@ nest and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to a tolerance of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and like a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of ra@@ dic@@ alization , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may be bra@@ in@@ washed , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen from the faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality against the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology reasons for their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that made sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and to the church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she insi@@ sted on joining the IS .
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ence studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more likely to accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people submit messages that were adver@@ sely reported about Muslims , they were more likely to agree to military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the allocation of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental clinic , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man come from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he fired on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safely at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we would like to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was holding me up .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had dar@@ ed courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or you will join those who believe : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy thinking mill , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before the air package reached our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre tower of 1,@@ 500 tiles live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
they can also build self @-@ deduc@@ tible structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and in general react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it needs to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be found on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
an aircraft that tries to strike two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most starter motors , it can ho@@ ver , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of tail star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that reach the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one function works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ate , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
even though it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move anywhere in the room .
but it doesn &apos;t have the sle@@ ek algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to take it right .
the likel@@ ihood of just throwing it right if everyone watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ ect is an exercise in suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary skill ,
move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if it is restricted too .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each of them weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe press over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
approximately 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very distant gal@@ axy were orbit@@ ing each other more and more quickly , so the mass of three suns cor@@ ed in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
for this brief moment they sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
a mere multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created just 1.3 billion years ago .
since then , the Earth has produced quite a few things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stand by us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group decided especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be greatly increased , which greatly improved the recognition rate .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes r@@ ushed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this one :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the departure of my father @-@ in @-@ law father .
the fruits of my work were basically the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is over@@ drawn , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and then moved into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often lead a properly al@@ arming dance in courses of rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ ped by the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the lig@@ o staff declared ins@@ ane .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a atomic nucleus . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described by Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne has published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
it is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
the face of your child , for example .
instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make a simple picture of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu .
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hear Lig@@ o following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; No one who knows what he has to hear know this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which spin around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns circles around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
much in space we can &apos;t see - practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because they are op@@ aque .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the type of stars that highlight black holes like Lig@@ o they are observing are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the no@@ od@@ les for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of what happened in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the universe &apos;s noise and circulation .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to everything I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to begin the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , eliminated my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from that moment on , I was sw@@ inging to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say for playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , stir up life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce TV .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which simultaneously are in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself , and not just produced , so there &apos;s top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say to you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you now run a company , a country or a class room , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just typing around on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it is true when I say that it does not dream about a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened into my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
that &apos;s how to make a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is to sum up .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on it .
many people assume that I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m writing about writing that writing is a joy for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started with television production when I began to work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a tot@@ um then you can &apos;t strive differently from size .
the feeling not to be different than striving for size no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more crowded boundaries , the more work there is , the more things are watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp , the sw@@ amp .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ mon@@ ing stopped .
the engine bu@@ zz was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sw@@ amp didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , re@@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not sleeping , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ ading down the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you do , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when you already know the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things become aware of :
first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sw@@ am bet@@ ters , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the bu@@ zz , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , soft voices , al@@ ert@@ ina pins and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl is letting go into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sw@@ amp , but a sw@@ amp .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the sums of titles , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe my brain with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how function@@ ally my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the flow that comes from the z@@ est of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums ignore the pressures of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I make this a solid rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not just as wise as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be a house ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we ras@@ en in the garden , forward and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst open soap bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe meet me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream woman .
you probably are right , but you can also do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit is replacing me .
and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I &apos;m mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need .
everyone can hang up for 15 minutes , even on a bad day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner ready for children .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my wellness oasis , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s all about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll leave and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes by piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not I ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is my sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only one part . I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ gg@@ ard to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country that I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz , the other , the real bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things look like , I &apos;ll stir you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing capability .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brain stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circuits so that the neurological function is improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with cran@@ ial trauma .
you have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure in case of skull @-@ brain trauma .
to save life , you have to reduce the stroke of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove part of a s@@ wollen part of the brain .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our bra@@ ins .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they staying with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however , from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are confronted with a potential source of cell that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we stro@@ lled the same individual at the est@@ an@@ cia of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto @-@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we stro@@ de these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we inflic@@ ted an injury and stro@@ ked exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ pled .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we used in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained no evil monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feed pellets from one tablet .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor sector in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen with people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you can see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we cycl@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the her@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fr . Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to look at it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable truths .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact democracy is f@@ ading with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who told me that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are wrong , we could save democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are mur@@ m@@ uring , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , but are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could be deduc@@ ted from the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except for infl@@ ating the stock exchanges and raising the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , as in an endless loop strengthens the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in an endless loop , encourages those who do not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who would be afraid that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily turns the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to k@@ ills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
his most extravag@@ ant kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many of course --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they admitted to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote wei@@ ghting in questions of state @-@ of @-@ affairs .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which in the end was a pro@@ posi@@ tional phrase for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , there was a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by gradually taking up politics and expos@@ ing it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is due to the fact that nowadays one can be in the government and yet not in power because power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my stri@@ de with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals , from which it feeds , that it is star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the inequality rises , the general economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; maintains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin @-@ summit higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon as I believe it will come in countries like China .
we must resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a dise@@ ased monitoring hyper@@ car cluster that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; look like a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used to transform people into the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia , rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from redemption , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin summit .
in the sphere of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is simultaneously more liberal , in which it prefers privileged persons , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will we aw@@ aken in such a world ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused .
BG : yes , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said it . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the or@@ ators have told you very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is played -- the area of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in some respects , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to acc@@ use China now is to do what the West has done in the 19th century , brut@@ ally sm@@ ashing in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- inci@@ dentally , the first proposal that revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , have continued to den@@ ounce denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Ernst aft ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make a mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be even more pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone will not survive .
for if they don &apos;t survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will be as detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the contents that will produce Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of that curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ts where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average circulation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t enth@@ use them .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing so , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , do you intervene , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
you are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a little different .
instead of having a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the ratings they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the pieces together they entered a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work that way , it is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company of Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope none in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always creates the best results . it &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that , due to data analysis , they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , by analy@@ sing the Google research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a release in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year by year by year , until it suddenly worked no more ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publishing in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most accomplished companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data is increasingly moving into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as deciding on cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized a few patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into your individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a conclusion .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they otherwise would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were competing for TV ideas , when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just one tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ or or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will contest it later with a demo of technology .
so far I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life , with which I should have been listening to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
