<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had heard illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has called upon Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get that information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had for years indicated that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and risking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly ordered his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit card, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's presumed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in touch instead of hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been given when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular mail or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any regular contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot get more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Sorry, there is no translation for this news-article.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to get offences. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abuses in the supply of soldiers and reports of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague who raises the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crime but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of history was published.] [the Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has mailbox offices in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of childhood days, a famous celist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous waiting for the next release, and on the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a spy or John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for major public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these Disclosure is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these giants.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting also that there are less reports in the US on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who perished in these revelations, this scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak of the Cayman Islands, or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off especially vulnerable grooves.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked all of us that all of us were suggesting a lawyer to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covert investigative.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior complicate." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound absurd as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever been changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I can see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last couple of years we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has entered central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US hinders here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies I made a sales outlet.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me excitedly how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while paying the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him first! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to be kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Well, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I rock in there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slept on tips to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me hangs in his classroom today. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners were actually friends who only waited for being discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform anxiety into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and established such" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">When we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I gazed at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-worker, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite other people to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is yet wholly at ease would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aimed at.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Put your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touch of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can read not only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is the way most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us Twitter that he is candidates for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told how to come from, how does his dog or his children mean?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 ratings, all of them say: "he can really stick to very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system will strengthen confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their judgements before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the people most that are the most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It gets exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing will change.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation weakens commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from it.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you're told too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "say too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there's an optimal degree of openness, such as "great works of art in your apartment! I'll be on vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you design it with design to make this level of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unlawful parties or ravaged dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, 123 million overnight stays were only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men have trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonderful things can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks because of sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charging extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is about economic trade here." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is simply not to call it" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy is describing a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would wait for a group there to fill a thoroughly and show you at a pub crawl, of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs have been started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. on our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries alone will be guest at a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had such a big impact, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport's safety check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness-fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>

<seg id="303">I remember as I rode in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said, "Be alert," "Be careful," "Abide in well-lit territories," "Get you not."</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: you remove a malignant tumor as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, earnest and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a tolerance of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalization, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists may be brainwashed, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen from the faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality against the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology reasons for their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. each clergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that made sense to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and to the church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she insisted on joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more likely to accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people submit messages that were adversely reported about Muslims, they were more likely to agree to military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumcision of American Muslims' rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we would like to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw was holding me up.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had dared courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package reached our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre tower of 1,500 tiles live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-deductible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turmoil and in general react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it needs to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be found on the highest level, e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to strike two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter motors, it can hover, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tail starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that reach the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one function works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospate, the mechanically simple remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Even though it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and can move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it doesn't have the sleek algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to take it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of just throwing it right if everyone watch me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospect is an exercise in sufficiency, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if it is restricted too.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each of them weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe press over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">Approximately 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very distant galaxy were orbiting each other more and more quickly, so the mass of three suns cored in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this brief moment they shone brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">A mere multi-cell life on Earth was created just 1.3 billion years ago.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced quite a few things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stand by us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group decided especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser-interferometer- gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be greatly increased, which greatly improved the recognition rate.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this one:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure of my father-in-law father.</seg>
<seg id="491">The fruits of my work were basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes for 23 years and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the wave is overdrawn, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and then moved into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers often lead a properly alarming dance in courses of relativity theory.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and striped by the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the ligo staff declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described by Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves like this:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne has published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob breaks them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make a simple picture of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- hear Ligo following: [Surrender noise] No one who knows what he has to hear know this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which spin around as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns circles around one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see - practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is hidden by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the type of stars that highlight black holes like Ligo they are observing are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the noodles for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of what happened in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe's noise and circulation.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes" "" "to everything I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to begin the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from that moment on, I was swinging to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "say for playing with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things out, stir up life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which simultaneously are in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I have created myself, and not just produced, so there's top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you now run a company, a country or a class room, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I'm not just typing around on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say that it does not dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened into my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">That's how to make a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is to sum up.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that I declare to them the sums that I'm writing about writing that writing is a joy for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started with television production when I began to work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a totum then you can't strive differently from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than striving for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more crowded boundaries, the more work there is, the more things are watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the swamp, the swamp, the swamp.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the summoning stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzz was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The swamp didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, reworked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a titanium is not sleeping, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fading down the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "howl, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you do, you're working, you love what you're doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when you already know the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" poses a question to me.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things become aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone any more" "" "babbling" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my swam betters, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the buzz, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, soft voices, alertina pins and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl is letting go into "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the swamp, but a swamp.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the sums of titles, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe my brain with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functionally my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the flow that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums ignore the pressures of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a solid rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not just as wise as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "myself." ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, forward and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst open soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe meet me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naïve, for a daydream woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably are right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show-character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit is replacing me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I'm mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can hang up for 15 minutes, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner ready for children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellness oasis, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's all about joy,</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="778">It's snuggard to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfire still burn.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing capability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the" "" "brain stimulation" "". "in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons" "" "circuits so that the neurological function is improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with cranial trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain swells the brain and increases the cranial pressure in case of skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the stroke of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove part of a swollen part of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brains.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are confronted with a potential source of cell that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we strolled the same individual at the estancia of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- auto-transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we strode these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we inflicted an injury and stroked exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimpled.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we used in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained no evil monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor sector in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brains. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we cycled the cells: the same monkey, two months after the hermplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Fr. Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable truths.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact democracy is fading with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are wrong, we could save democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are murmuring, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, but are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income that could be deducted from the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months in the United States, England and the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except for inflating the stock exchanges and raising the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twins of twins, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand which, as in an endless loop strengthens the pessimism of investors, which, as in an endless loop, encourages those who do not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus father, who would be afraid that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily turns the circumstances causing Oedipus to kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His most extravagant kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"" "" "" "Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government." ""</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed too many of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they admitted to them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in questions of state-of-affairs.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a propositional phrase for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, there was a relentless struggle between the two by gradually taking up politics and exposing it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is due to the fact that nowadays one can be in the government and yet not in power because power is migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my stride with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's about like a herd of carnivores, which has so sustainably decimated the animals, from which it feeds, that it is starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the inequality rises, the general economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" maintains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle, without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin-summit higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon as I believe it will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must reshape the economy and reunite the sectors of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a diseased monitoring hypercar cluster that makes the film "Matrix" look like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used to transform people into the study of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia, rather than the "Matrix" -like dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from redemption, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging economies], in the interests of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously more liberal, in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">"" "" "" "will we awaken in such a world?" ""</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive drop in aggregate demand what Larry Summers calls for "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore I am a Libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: yes, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said it. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the orators have told you very clearly what you think about the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is played -- the area of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I can say this provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To accuse China now is to do what the West has done in the 19th century, brutally smashing in hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to us and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- incidentally, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the eurozone, have continued to denounce denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- Ernst aft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make a mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika's creditors, who imposed this policy on us, said:" "" "this was a colossal failure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be even more pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they don't survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to propose the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on 19th April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the contents that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of that curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addicts where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't care about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average circulation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't enthuse them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing so, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, do you intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of having a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix spectators, so the ratings they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they entered a risk and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work that way, it is a little frightening because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company of Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope none in this room ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. it's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that, due to data analysis, they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad type, by analysing the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a release in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year by year by year, until it suddenly worked no more,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publishing in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most accomplished companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data is increasingly moving into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as deciding on cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized a few patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into your individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second you put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they otherwise would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as they were competing for TV ideas, when they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just one tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaor or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely," "" "right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will contest it later with a demo of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I've made some decisions in my life, with which I should have been listening to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
