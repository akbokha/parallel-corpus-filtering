Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Institute , where young people are to meet today .
a chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich fo@@ sters exciting stories for days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , who had to upset himself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bayern of the state government , are anything but current - but very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; prim@@ ers &quot; sheets , were incorporated into the large general map for towns and villages .
according to the Bavarian Ver@@ veying Administration , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian version@@ ing administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / today is most impressive at the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , so in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today it is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Com@@ fort@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in appears a small @-@ scale card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
today , small plots occupy no more farmers than farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of the sub@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the location of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen one reads not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 there was the Munich circle @-@ asylum @-@ institution &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; ( Lü@@ ften mit der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften ) .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , finished the chains of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Cy@@ cli@@ que pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
to the west is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , Small Business H@@ ouses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were preceded by the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn road .
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fills the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based incidents happen in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group .
a recently passed Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to attract discrimination , as well as the State &apos;s law enforcement authorities who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate on minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being charged with a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready if they bring cow@@ or@@ king money or let relatives know they are going through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation program of the FBI , which classi@@ fy the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States have adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to the further re@@ profil@@ ing of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a success project and will continue in the coming year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac created an image on the spot .
at the right gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he generates 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t generate profit@@ ably on such steep faces .
the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot of things must be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not perform bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader fo@@ stering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the re@@ forest@@ ation of the land could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue to operate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often critici@@ zed because of funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 pitches of eleven participants were fenced with electric fence support .
the open @-@ maintenance area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half about leader was promoted , a quarter carried the village of Fischer@@ bach .
the farmers therefore left 12 6@@ 10 euros that they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of fence @-@ fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ladies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows for state support of for@@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a subsi@@ dy recorded by the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the enclosed area must not be smu@@ g@@ gled ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the forest@@ ation .
for the 2018 Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s electric fence project , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ plan area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated him if he had done it .
but he picked up its meaning , and in particular the meaning that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem , which you refer to , later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he himself formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the how@@ ling words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immig@@ rant , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , longing to breathe freely , the el@@ ining waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falling waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better visible on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tru@@ mps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very well that they had taken a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the big cry rush R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , poor , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
it is the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite hatred which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is remembered for a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the UK , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their capital speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; middle distance runner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year set up five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the med@@ als and with the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a big honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the ball@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the people of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until newspapers struck him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he was kno@@ cking at the criticism , for sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter response with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type such as Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his elec@@ tors and playing his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments would be nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors of the Gover@@ nor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times if you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of papers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter writer hit his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ iz@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed their position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement , and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken from the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his home country .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pulmon@@ ary cancer cases can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the building works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably close to time , &quot; said the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze project .
in the area of house connections , the location is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which continuously hin@@ ders the construction work , is a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s tru@@ pp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off doors is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ vir@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the err@@ atic ind@@ on@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 5@@ pm in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was commenced in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which was stirring up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour journey by car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and corrugated sheet roofs that were converted by rust into different yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we had only leaves at our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has a valued 78 billion US dollars worth of wood resources .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s were made to commit genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
last year , Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; we Are Mak@@ ing Every@@ thing &quot; is in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources make a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim migrant workers come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roast chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai Local who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including P@@ ani@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ran@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , ch@@ ased and hit the group with their rif@@ le @-@ pist@@ ons , saying the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre in order to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle running and a bird song im@@ i@@ ti@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started tow@@ ing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ak , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ran@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who was witness to the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Che@@ ese inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the disclosure of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims received such asser@@ tions with gri@@ m diso@@ be@@ dience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ asa insi@@ sted that people in P@@ ani@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered here , such as TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an inv@@ oc@@ ation for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Syrian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by insti@@ g@@ ating spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ die Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in P@@ ani@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; ensuring national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in R@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ il .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the tribal board of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain stra@@ ined .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although their rare permit was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Affairs Minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dismissed the group &apos;s alle@@ gations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him to &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Papua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i know that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ shot victims brought out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ak@@ obus with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest housing towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that in just two years swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which is often called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai Civil Defence authorities said that the fire fighting units cleared the fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident may rein@@ vigor@@ ate questions about the safety of materials used in areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the gate building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the Gren@@ fell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two profits , spar@@ sely not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but even therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics , the traditional value is preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the application .
even before the vote , the proposal had already come before the proposal to put the final in a neutral place .
the fin@@ alists will be the host right next year in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training places , etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official medi@@ ums before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a pol@@ l
a survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ intentionally prohibited objects are smu@@ g@@ gled over at the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden blades or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted they had know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were pur@@ pos@@ efully passed to T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 per cent reported to have know@@ ingly borne objects with clin@@ ici@@ ans by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately banned banned drugs in the aircraft .
the company said it consul@@ ted travelers across the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently made smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who were most smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure of which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the items banned by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA might look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ d@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already pulled back their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ changing figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time betra@@ yed another less brilliant figure when announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly results : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations occur , mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 , a million in 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that have never been tested in practice without greater inter@@ ruption with maximum occup@@ ancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in pairs .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt draws back on the reduction of emissions due to the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline which took place on October 1 for States to comply with the 2015 standards for the bottom @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly crossed over to block or delay regul@@ ators , resist@@ ing the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ster regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his down@@ turn in o@@ zone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EP@@ O for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority we give to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive set @-@ up of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , New York &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , who led the Coalition of States that had su@@ ed the EP@@ O this week , said that the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of those 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ v@@ anian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and conserv@@ ation@@ ists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ding &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting the ideological cru@@ el@@ ty of the Tru@@ mp government to turn to environmental pollutants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , a Ser@@ en@@ ade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius press is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle ( St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle ) was first mentioned in written reference in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Chamber of Württemberg : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church at Tum@@ lingen with the Vo@@ g@@ atory &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patron was right and not the other way around .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the lower village and the upper village , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the community centre of the village .
ancient maps dating back to the 1600 &apos;s date back these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church .
connected to this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the two of them melt together at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the second world war in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke out the steep@@ le and half fell .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower remaining today remained as a witness to the 750 year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ y Rent@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle St. Hil@@ aria chapel on Sunday , 16th July .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
at the end of the seren@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view across meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers discover the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tumours and audi@@ tori@@ ums .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , such as seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at that time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there was a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette by a change in the land use plan - but the Düsseldorf district government had not approved , because of a form @-@ fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning , the approved approval certificate is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the place where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the district of Vier@@ sen for last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle is on the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings in the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ year households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg region .
car and Trac@@ tor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police figures , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother , drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and traders are planning &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ thal and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants of the shopping spre@@ e to the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Business In@@ corporation , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket product .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training vac@@ ancies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
Stadt@@ Administration und Gewerbe@@ verein co@@ operates with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the industrial society and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest including a sale on Sunday , talks with all the business@@ men and hosts in order to make them active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local residents would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was a question of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network which had spread in part , had said King in the spring .
Birgit Kn@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce at the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , informed that five Thurin@@ gian cities were participating in the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his immediate surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school

as a result , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline .
only a few people were staying in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp put pressure on trans@@ liter@@ ated phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp , in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , asked to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him of publicly den@@ oun@@ cing the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia is ridi@@ culous , &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp terminated the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and glan@@ ced at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens rights activists have been coming back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our communities even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want law enforcement , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician establishes a sheet about the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ trial .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although susp@@ ects have been on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer .
about the same time as the choice st@@ jah according to the FBI &apos;s black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell down during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that ru@@ mo@@ urs in the city had been that H@@ ester was sleeping with Mrs. Dor@@ othy with Mal@@ com@@ s wife and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they came from the prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes with an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and disgu@@ ised the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more form@@ id@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right to vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has managed the annual follow @-@ up of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene co @-@ director &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Her@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he van@@ ishes away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ hid answers the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers thunder@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compani@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed in a dream dress , stands over the corp@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from his eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple travelled from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy m@@ um@@ bles as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the reproduction with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me lets me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; Today , this is called police shooting . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone visits Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not study his own history who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f relies on a colorful , fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sk@@ ul@@ led street corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ daughters pose as a rock energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Ca@@ stor@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhine @-@ daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully well as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
he seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ manner , a corp@@ se in the trunk and give the Kra@@ v@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) will have to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ mil@@ dly , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of the pipe concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; you notice that the audience is somehow related to the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the public did not only make a form of peace with Ca@@ stor@@ f , but it was also an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive resume .
Max lot works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a high school ex@@ ams .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably doing a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different operations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
it can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing , which has irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calculating stagn@@ ation .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been taken out of the family - one has to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not the guy for that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job reduction announced by the General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 will come in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May in a third cost reduction program , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after a 1 percent increase of 2.1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , shared an explanation by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive force . &quot;
the statement states that all injured were in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Air@@ field B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering raising the number of U.S. forces that support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule acc@@ . to law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , repe@@ aled that States are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done one day after 15 states acc@@ using the agency for the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it will show the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , in order to establish where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental records imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the demo@@ crats and nature protection groups to worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants to have community space
at the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ elt decides to establish a community space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the site was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time for the area belonging to the church community until now , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide an area of living space - approximately 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are preparing such a common room not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ opho@@ bia , but openly enter into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided in the last autumn by means of funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a community space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , by 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed solution fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this regard there is no bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , the statement that both semi @-@ tra@@ ilers are le@@ aning against the environment , as well as the roof of the roof , which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t just mean this additive .
when it helps : it passes unanim@@ ously the body .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela reputation points to the many own buildings with which you can &apos;t go so well , but now you lean towards the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very difficult with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the common room - but absolutely against municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investor .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no allowance , but get a real exchange value , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to adopt the proposed resolution finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and was seriously injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove on the road , however , he apparently did not heed the traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown on the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch wagon .
Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba will have to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven pros lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
human resources at the German soccer record champion Bayern München are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BA@@ B on David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the min@@ ors Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti is responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important thing is balance in the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to meet the need for information for many har@@ lot @-@ go@@ ers , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members wish to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiries ka@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be added via the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location .
barrier @-@ free is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star was more lumin@@ ous than another , although it was considerably farther away .
it will also be taught in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path in the university town of Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads with its stel@@ es up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planets - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is just over four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would still last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 kil@@ os , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were welcomed in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the unbe@@ aten World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , who went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko fi@@ erc@@ ely def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move on lightweight trucks &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also is interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the forum on 23 September .
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed frank@@ ly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave gener@@ ously praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ exit . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ zer
in an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a at 4.@@ 30 p.m. , shortly before the junction point of the market , probably lost control of his vehicle after a tire plat@@ ter .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the slope , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance , the A@@ 7 was blocked north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could pass by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 to start the season op@@ ener in Braunschweig for the optimisation of defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was pleased with the result , even if the two opponents were not at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two ad@@ versaries too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle can also be further optimized .
and a gate after a free@@ wheel the for@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better with the tri@@ erk@@ et after the experiences in preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ et .
&quot; I don &apos;t know yet how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the triangle on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t do so much ab@@ duction in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann comes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight play days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e just because the match of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a little fres@@ her , because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly the guests from the Rhin@@ eland tend to be a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so spark@@ le doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ based evaluation tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started conducting the tests last year .
they are said to be more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in judging the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics in recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det analysed the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they were going to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally speaking , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is in@@ accurate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a concrete section of seven tons was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three reconstructed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge , covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fixing that is also used as an operating path .
on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
the special thing about this is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ ing over the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building farm building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach place entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed .
the costs for the three brid@@ ges@@ hips will amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest in german potato salad
it is not so common that parties draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the county of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites to a poster of &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who have been on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain square , but now takes place in the parking place underneath the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the forum One World and one of the organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could easily eat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ mes reports about the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel , he tried to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at about 8@@ pm , a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz provides various or@@ ators in the Stadthalle , among them the Rhine @-@ country @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ener Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to speak .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ event lasts , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can cr@@ ush - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European premi@@ eres .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
in this way Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by the jazz @-@ winner N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , classical , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it for both musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs will be consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely out of their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I join grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleague , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with every one of you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten declared that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she especially suffered as she dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a great deal of thought ... Today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp first announced a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and inherited from his father a coal business .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last refusal of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , inclusive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ person Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been gra@@ bbed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , IA@@ AF voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which begin on Friday in London based on the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ps for Mali@@ an soldiers killed in Mali
during a funeral service at Nord@@ h@@ ess@@ ische frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to the un@@ enlightened fall , Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two revers@@ ed pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a German army fire station in St. Peter &apos;s Cathedral on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church took their leave .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens premi@@ er Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general contractor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trau@@ gri@@ ev@@ ste laid down roses , and the families were standing in arm with the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the helicopter pilot in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger @-@ drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ acher , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of the Le@@ yen didn &apos;t show doubts about the UN Mission in Mali : it was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Dom@@ kirche of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also sets out the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 in London .
he worked in the French embassy on the Th@@ ames .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ under@@ ing , Prince Hen@@ rik had a grave stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday he spoke for the resolution of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , the surprise resignation of a Green party in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est , the former Green MEP , established their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
group leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to encourage his faction to record it .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new parliament will be elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the Red @-@ Green Land government now has to decide whether or not to go@@ vern this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Parliament decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the country &apos;s day depri@@ ves the prime minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all questions if they are legally scrut@@ in@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ern@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a practitioner of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous MPs to return their parliament mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she returns her country mandate , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the regional president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D vice @-@ president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests extraordinarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to take any pron@@ oun@@ cements in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor , Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens from El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the parliament .
the leaving of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and their fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Prime Minister Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to take El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests into the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the Parliament election in 2013 with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force in front of the SPD , but in parliament the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote .
agriculture Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal States provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to all we know at the moment , a health endanger@@ ment is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has switched off immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ may of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same concern as manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual hardness level of 0.00@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
however un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the present state of knowledge , the production company does not make any immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are too few controllers in case of emergency .
is it only lacking in the personnel or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely this reason that a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ utor in cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already pointed out several times that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ ting really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by means of the fixed assets , manufacturers , traders and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide &apos; fi@@ pron@@ il &apos; in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all competent authorities to ensure that the facts are elu@@ ci@@ dated quickly and without gaps .
how football rules affecting N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted spending of European football associations will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequence will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the executive organisation supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G needs to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose in order to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the team &apos;s financing through the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must counter@@ act legitimate income sources that enable them to break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their quest for success effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrawn their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P delay period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , its UEF@@ A successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , will continue to impose excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid out the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Cat@@ ar@@ ist company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsorship was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup is going to be ambass@@ adors and that such manoeu@@ v@@ res for the UEF@@ A regulation authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to comply with any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of over € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new supplier
in the past years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a potential end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 17 million small red @-@ white boxes of 14 grams distribute each year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants prior to landing at the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide information about the cost .
according to industry insi@@ der estimates , the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs . Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but even more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
the Swiss won &apos;t want to reveal how many applicants are there during the new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is trying to rev@@ ise the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate maker was not achiev@@ able for an opinion .
chocolate bars distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g before joining a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter .
Swiss was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are pam@@ pered with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class , will also be presented on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play tight children who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering system principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand showing the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character viol@@ ates an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy mal@@ ign plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ sung impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub @-@ lip font of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental del@@ u@@ sions that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon also reminds us of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka as director gives to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 80s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic is@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are syn@@ ced .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some pretty big g@@ ags for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find the voice &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited to a lesser extent , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything possible for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have hit the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials made large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros safe .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian prosec@@ ut@@ ors were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been investigating the organized drug trade in Southern Germany .
between the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go into the bank account .
Weise vac@@ ated big gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , the commission@@ er for refugee management , according to a media report , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the recorded data could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nation@@ als are registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data has not been sufficiently cared for , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer show up in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data entries can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficient people , moreover , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German federal government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy once they have gone from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , BA@@ MF is referring to such methods &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has provided guarantees for the inclusion and housing of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send back refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokesperson for the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threaten human rights because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system and a danger to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided blood don@@ or service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
especially Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with its 100 donations , now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the municipality t@@ ames multiple eag@@ ern@@ ess to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it &apos;s awesome how our body is created for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Kreis@@ blatt director of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the D@@ RK county manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the switch to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 performed blood donations .
half so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter accounted for ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members stri@@ pped in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in their quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts by 1.7 % for 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation in autumn expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit expenses might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial funds for banks from the coming February although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak short @-@ term as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest it was repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; bigger &quot; scale than the markets would expect .
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these messages .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest income and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % .
growth will probably be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low levels of salary , as the sharpen@@ ing first gets worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which is partly offset by lower consumption spending .
the decision comes one year after the drop in interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the p@@ act to decline .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest income increased because inflation boo@@ sted the pressure on hard pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation has decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June although the Bank said it was expected and it will attract it again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the transgres@@ sion in relation to its target of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Ber@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks great for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in N@@ HS from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yl@@ actic proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year &apos;s Supreme Court ruling stating that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in all of England .
pre@@ p proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with a high level of HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is actually controlled individually and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV can be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ ded in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling wasn &apos;t large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled the fan to place two spaces in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classical copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make him look for a longer time .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obj@@ ection@@ able , so when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to not leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a debate about one of Victori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate empire valued at over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there she founded West@@ co jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in , described by Paul as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in has property valued at $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought about the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul says , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul to manage some property in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Lie@@ gen@@ schaft in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 were hoping to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark earned 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the conditions of their financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very well , even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and , following a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by text message to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw up our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new chief of staff plans to restrict the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior staff at his first working day , he presented a major problem in president Donald Tru@@ mps White House that he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the president .
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mps &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry about fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mps Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have contained even more ignition material without their intervention .
we will probably never know about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his co @-@ workers manage to keep anger from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp controversy .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
politicians - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officers say that Tru@@ mp is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , gave the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson is permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document Pap@@ i@@ erk@@ ram . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the aid of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police throughout Europe sent in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in flight .
as the addresses of the searched s@@ words are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on Friday that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar is coming from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many cur@@ ses were hiding at vacation destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested , at least 11 of them on the basis of indications after the publication on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on war@@ base , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch drawn by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense systems and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pedestri@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mons when the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman at Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to make them move as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible sign an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forest hotel Lu@@ ise from Bir@@ k@@ enhof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Bir@@ k@@ enhof Hotel .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambience operating company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 over@@ nights were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a gathering place , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the deployment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt , Mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and spoke to the house of serious interested parties back then .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly removed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to be done by March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer plays out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high level of downtown , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer more .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has conducted conversations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city are the same as those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under one million Euros , he reck@@ oned .
the external systems are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Agent sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US president Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the panel has recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , referring to people familiar with the issue .
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N station reported that there are already the first sub@@ po@@ enas of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have accused the Krem@@ lin of interven@@ ing specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mps fran@@ chise campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tru@@ mps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the special agent Tru@@ mp came to the centre in person and for@@ bi@@ ds the accus@@ ation if the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to review this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide if an indictment is to be charged .
Grand Jury are therefore also referred to as Indi@@ ct@@ als .
in most cases , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite people to take a hearing under oath .
according to the CN@@ N station , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was reported in the report .
they should also provide documents .
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mps couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his acting campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were talking about the conversation .
legal experts told on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller doesn &apos;t let himself in@@ timi@@ date in his work and that if necessary , he should act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the new revelations , the president on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
but this also works normally in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House appro@@ ves all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be determined against the president .
you have no reason to accept that something has changed in it , it was mentioned in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired .
because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become lou@@ dly , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey testified in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to stop the investigations against the then National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president is under great pressure because of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was fired .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired from the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday that the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has detached from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin by the ice shelf .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over one tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now drives north@@ ward and will probably need two , three years , until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg , research data is unclear .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the col@@ los@@ ed col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us .
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was disturbed several years ago .
a complete shelf will fall there , writes A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet stand under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key location .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not raise sea level , as it flo@@ ats on the water and squee@@ zes ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers straight into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a lesser extent , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the records began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is the question whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly gather together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not decline the break@@ age of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has fallen apart during the past few decades .
this long tip of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the drop in temperature had contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees over the past 50 years , thus counting on the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
it was only shortly before the summer break that 41 new jobs were inst@@ ated in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the apprenticeship places in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be found for the places to be held this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 un@@ occupied spots in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for human resources and human resources development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking candidate short@@ ages .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate both internally and extern@@ ally , point out concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education campaign , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know earlier .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
thus , it is high time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Turn@@ bull , the leader of the CD@@ U , goes further with his party on the common motion .
he had long been worried about a bad surprise when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money only if you change to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO &apos;s migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warn that they cannot continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express himself in detailed proposals by the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that his crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants onboard that are delivered directly to them by human traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard who monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable because they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan civil may@@ ors this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer brackets instead of fighting through stadium racing in the event of wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ ys included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also been recognized by the first states of the Federal Republic of Germany , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg won the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and at the end of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still several clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London will host the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now consul@@ ted an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer any markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets on @-@ line , than to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the e @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just football simulation games are fought on a competition level .
as in the normal sport , Li@@ es have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other .
and by 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a kind of sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certain to get used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ o has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which can be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability are needed .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to rise to 130 million .
this is little compared to the approximately 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the US , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ os .
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , the football @-@ first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to dis@@ miss only in nostal@@ gia and to glori@@ fy the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that everything remains as it was always in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy driving suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is ou@@ tri@@ ght . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and looking down eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she did not take any responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not have the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain , for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , build yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ju@@ dge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ Captain .
well , the deposit could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .

Kim@@ i said : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ushed over the field as a mini @-@ kite .
to the right of the rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i acted in this initial formation as the one who can also take the helm in my hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ heard tro@@ upe .
he had a glimpse of the whole while many others were busy themselves .
Vi@@ dal &apos;s inability to over@@ play his missing fitness ( did not fold ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches means to get out of the performance of the Asia trip on the devil ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it not to be neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance at the Bayern Tri@@ cot .
but all this worked out very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acting confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a couple of times successfully in playing the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; player reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also brought up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few clicks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you simply have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new again .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ ser pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Economic Secretary Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region respond to T V requests from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously t@@ ad@@ le the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al is natural in infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is supposed to be the right of construction .
the west circum@@ vention of Trier is also a part of the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal traffic plan .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that has been bag@@ ged for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates are independent within ten years of master education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , at the same time it fails to provide the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
up to now only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf is referring to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the Land invested more than 20 million euros less than suggested by country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country , as will remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band extension in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies it already cleared the field .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi BMW said that it would offer to update the software into more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said that the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for autom@@ akers to install machinery to neutr@@ alize the exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful automobile companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to join , on Saturday morning a raft runs through Munich , which has a special message .
if you want to go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a huge raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large infectious agent .
it shows a mil@@ ler .
the start of an ou@@ tre@@ ach campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a worthy wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
at the end of the day , there will be a lot of laughter and laughter .
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the no@@ ises of his characters are his hall@@ mark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he worked as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation post@@ cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s : with the release of its carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he is still on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and clo@@ cks continue to find a lot of dis@@ semination worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ fold as opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence being threatened with climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of dro@@ ught and insect @-@ borne insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has an impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ z@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed , and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dro@@ ught .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while the corp@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ uth .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared issues , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is now more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely around Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug roy@@ alty that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival carto@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspi@@ cious gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was to not force Val@@ dez to seize the country for its own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for North Korea in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the poison gas problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved it to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she won the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , always sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the Ri@@ odo@@ ce offices in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters in@@ quired if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the governor himself designated as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are actually under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has focused on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former famous Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the state expendi@@ tures that concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost ruled all the political levels almost the entire century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they themselves have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez cut a few notes and went to the office of the prosec@@ utor the next morning for another journalist .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become even stronger throughout the country by written down &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings in organized protests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them , because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re@@ organised by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue making El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and searching for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trafficking was frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer than at one time all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
19 confirmed dead were left behind a series of rif@@ les with belt enri@@ ches and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ tail@@ gate , they have published the news on the web site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via cell phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are resting near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ ation of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; din@@ osau@@ r ever found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r examples in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that was out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only tw@@ inkl@@ ing a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa die din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a reci@@ proc@@ ity , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to interfere with its surroundings better and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mar@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with carefully covering it .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the Intelligence , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .
although the counter @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ shade - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors have been of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ ton to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sun@@ k on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermoplas@@ tic , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the King of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying predec@@ essors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavier monster .
scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average around 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ b@@ ust cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto .
the more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
its right foref@@ oot is on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ sions
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long jams - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , between 17@@ h@@ 00 and 5@@ pm , between the junction centres Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed .
the exact number of publishers initially did not provide any information .
it was about light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long back was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reported , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the car en@@ ker , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 6.@@ 45 p.m. a second accident took place at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : you just sit in the train and sleep .
or one is immersed in his work and has just a genius thought .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the hass@@ le @-@ free ticket control .
one simply confirms by phone that one takes its place and vali@@ dates the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many further long @-@ distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trains the train ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like that : you go to the train , call his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers a button for electronic de@@ valuation will appear .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep quiet .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ d@@ ants simply check in in the DB Navigator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB long @-@ distance marketing executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket checks are among the greatest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents that one needs to de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , resulting in poor ath@@ mosph@@ ere in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the woman in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live on twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , un@@ insured another polic@@ eman his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... all animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23.@@ 00 she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a floral dress and a matching crown , the two had a talk that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them with them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the minority student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which prof@@ ited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ red their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt passengers .
his engagement brought about Fer@@ rell the project , along with six other locals followed the &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life , as she falls in love with her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the incar@@ nation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have taken the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at which Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels oblig@@ ated to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while one at the bit gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ st ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , from which the other shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct will be bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this will end with the start of the construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Rooms : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been selling in the farmers market almost every week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ wives again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many stores here stand empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a good weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly directly offered by the producer and is priced at the top price .
as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger firms , as the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , there are almost no special deals and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit @-@ Gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already before , to drive all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and there is no need to buy a shopping mall that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after publicly dis@@ credited diplomatic news on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans @-@ woman and landmark dis@@ sertation , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created an algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary , not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
through prison , their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits vag@@ u@@ ely on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became an un@@ equal bri@@ g@@ ade , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a cartoon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili @-@ Kan@@ ung@@ o , who predicted a future in which the President would transform the judgement and she would be able to personally see the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama really was just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would require a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp is launching a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to solve the rigid spl@@ its he should actually resolve .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement , written down on the wall of the Gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ end of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how remarkably similar , at least in biological respect , we are all .
&quot; what hopefully people will take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in the hand of the disciplinary teams of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they let your talk be cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ tics , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg about the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford looking for killing
a nationwide hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford employee who will be sought as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectiv@@ es examine the stit@@ ches as a murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that it was now in the absence of an assessment and was excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal off@@ ence examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly calls on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that trucks and war@@ ts were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren about state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia by WA@@ DA in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA executive director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next one
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not believe the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ ups race is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to circum@@ vent managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next one who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former colleague has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the Financial Technical Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent gives companies tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS @-@ Hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive officer is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has deployed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company Con@@ ver@@ cent utili@@ zes , problems previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can draw closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment liti@@ gations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical breach by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both startups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
sli@@ pping secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer venture partner and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is listening to their votes , and that the work you do , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture are important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can result in dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have gone too much to collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so rescu@@ es .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was due to the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players are chat@@ ting on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot tops and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ solic@@ ited minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ en &apos;s coach Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ligh@@ ten the burden of the players , and she has actually length@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ges moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times carried out practical exercises .
20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for the start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change in rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been dump@@ ed with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a pe@@ at post , will not be an easy task .
bru@@ te players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then hire them to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and then show their results in the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to get rid of hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by fak@@ ers of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook would continue testing its feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen the wrong news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its comfortable seat in the Ju@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says to melanchol@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ nail on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) it all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ enas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust got the full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who had : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Pe@@ as@@ ants &apos; uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it emperor , who hid the family Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , who stages his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to promote arous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ kel@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign on Friday for the launch of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday through Nelson Ar@@ tz .
at the end of August there will be a celebration at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that we as Bad Honnef citizens are very familiar with the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in the competition with other commun@@ es .
the city of Bad Honnef will cost a mean five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in former times , but in the prime minister &apos;s office .
under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister now also took part in the discussions .
as a result , the civilians of the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ time .
the government dra@@ gs the reign@@ s in the military .
the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who looks at the Erdo@@ gan as a clin@@ cher of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been acting in Ankara since this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the crash test as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the great deal in the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were sooner than the actual men of the country .
these three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is specifically pav@@ ing the way for an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt , was seeking refuge abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not let NATO get cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army after pur@@ ges in the alliance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato &apos;s diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he proposes to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for motor@@ sport shuttle
over the past few months we have been argu@@ ing about the future of the race pav@@ ement - now it &apos;s time to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train runs , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ ais@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will start on the track this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g circuit , the country is firmly committed to tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , secretary of state Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route amounted to approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country occupies 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alized , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the used vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of 11 years .
the race @-@ sti@@ g @-@ shuttle is to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a large number of people to order it regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts heavy b@@ ump@@ y .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the realm of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are a big thing at the moment .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ps have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye color to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples down to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively look . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ps have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they appeal to , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ ani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the True Comp@@ ani@@ on website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spirit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when you go a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , worry a most .
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy compared with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or offen@@ ding until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who boasts that women have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed bodies and the stoch@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex @-@ robots consists in creating a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tru@@ mp large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ mp agreement of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp @-@ choosing relatives .
we all strain ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is linked to me in another context that it also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the distor@@ ting impact of his presi@@ dency has the strength to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be rep@@ elled one day any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more horri@@ fic long @-@ term scenario where Tru@@ mp is re@@ public@@ ising the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today trapped by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both found in fact one of very mild off@@ ences in comparison to Tru@@ mp .
when Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable enhancement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ bling music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still out of the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can walk on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first death belt for murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , firing it several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , saying they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ person wat@@ chers from F@@ arch@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of them will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte on Tuesday evening welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Far@@ n@@ erhof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a hen @-@ clo@@ aking a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken cut off from him , and the eagle lifted up his wings on a high mountain , and was s@@ wollen .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ g@@ gles , the cylinders wore to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ person äss@@ ler that he feels accepted in his new school .
there was thanks to the teachers , formerly Schul@@ leiter , Michael Müller , who is always involved in instruc@@ tional bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over now , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher declared .
after two years of teaching , she leaves her students very ung@@ rat@@ eful , because it has been a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the four @-@ person äss@@ ler .
at the end all students had a song of summ@@ er@@ time and holiday periods .
in doing so , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , refer@@ enced by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally w@@ aking people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have ag@@ grav@@ ated control over the free camping and lay hands on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars of the E@@ missions Vehic@@ les Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Automobile Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting was ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet mentioned a precise date .
Daimler announces to write to any person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions be drawn in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the app@@ endi@@ ces depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to make an appointment .
what are drivers doing that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors .
awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US president Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows therefore already announced that he would do without the participation at the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ sts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will take advantage of the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make clear her view .
the Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the job has already been written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates during the press conference .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it surprises him that so far no application needs to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city is searching for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , considering the regular periods of notice , it should be enough time for a revision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub @-@ civil authority , the applicant must instruc@@ t relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill them out any more , the citizens would have to go to the Consul@@ t@@ ative Office up to Off@@ enburg .
but citizens are important to the city and themselves , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company climate and good mood among authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry some important projects have been collected , which the W@@ acker looks back on with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ floor parking lot are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be worth roughly 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city @-@ builder of great lati@@ tude .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned pra@@ ising by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what rein@@ forces &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ meister stresses .
the City Engineer bears a high responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( high construction ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , a completed academic degree or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture should be able to present architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) stands for civil and civil engineering , civil engineering , urban planning , urban landscap@@ ing , building yard and urban gardening , as well as the Lower Building Law Office , including the Protection of Monum@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bike on lines thrown : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; south railway track &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and look for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene , a red @-@ sho@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a land of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators had put themselves in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , the perpetr@@ ators of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum could be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern track could be guided without disabilities .
just under ten people were fond of Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found out at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not enter the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cell is found in mice carrying a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet more tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el li@@ eus if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same family , who had been separated , had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ cos@@ m of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in the mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i found themselves in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han &apos;s by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira were mar@@ ching at will .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the Blues tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent disclosed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four primary commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was an SPD leader , S &amp; D PM always looked for Berlin before elections .
only no bon@@ fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the electoral champi@@ ons .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House employees are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were deep @-@ set@@ backs .
and one after the other .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again demonstrates : red @-@ green can simply not reign reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
s &amp; D Euro MP Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has pushed the government of the Green Party into a heavy crisis .
five months before the Parliament &apos;s election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ führer Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Green Euro MPs El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and campaign manager of the Green International Legal Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD candidate si@@ ghs when the new Hi@@ de message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD &apos;s Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the resignation of Green Euro MPs , El@@ ke T@@ UV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD Land associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er started with the un@@ expect@@ edly sharp defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , was cal@@ med down by the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and it was all significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a whi@@ p , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ gh sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
comrades , the com@@ rade sha@@ ken up again in the weeks following .
then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit was held by Hamburg .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made pretty much everything that can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
for some time now , because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for quite some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey values were added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , or maybe just for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Bund over the past few weeks .
the ambi@@ tions of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ sts T@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Lower Saxony deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election of voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ MP fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the explanation of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or it has given further commitments by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding money for town core III
those who want to be rehabil@@ itated over the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed city development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there has been some rehabilitation zones .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous restructuring is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the total funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros were received from the country , the rest from the municipality of sens@@ ations .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabil@@ itating .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge was represented by Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be made object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a set of rules .
the grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year the survey would only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December it should take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can be started next year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about assessing the gri@@ ev@@ ances of the town and deciding when to renov@@ ate and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a refurb@@ ishment report in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sensation and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot bend &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it deals among other things about the construc@@ tional condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gray &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; details about the size , layout and dwell@@ ings of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , please note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of funds is working according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Urban II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself places himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory sti@@ cker at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event canc@@ eled U.S. manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to military data left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as nav@@ y One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was on display next to a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the notes of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the deputy military commander for aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 7@@ am for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this wasn &apos;t the case , &quot; wrote the comm@@ anding officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event the President gave an impetus for reform of the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation as the presidential air@@ liner was in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made in America , &quot; which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as a truck at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idential Support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in delivering the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ing records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW N@@ uss in front of a tricky task
top riders of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga join the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite after five games still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has got the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup bets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ r.@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , it is difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man currently active in the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella is not a member of the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament for his first time in this season .
the un@@ inhabited Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the White @-@ Russian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories against the Club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ u@@ z could once again be back in the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay takes up the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday night under the law for tightening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress brought in a few &quot; constitutional provisions . &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors in O@@ MV are worried about this , and jointly with other European companies , the construction of the Russian Eastern sou@@ theastern North Stream 2 has been co @-@ financed .
the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to bring the sanctions to life even as an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be at the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise , &quot; with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dami@@ an Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the new trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type that invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to stop the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ rest@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
R@@ ole R@@ ole : the City provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres , the clock is turned back .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy director in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked refriger@@ ated .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
last year , 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour support when children remain until 14 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service starting from 1 September : they heat the delivered food , complement them with salad , raw food and fruits , proportion@@ ate the meal individually , give out the meal , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistant now belongs to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ging of the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has turned out in cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the Council elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international struggles to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will hand over the power to the next democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ om said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.@@ 6 million elec@@ tors were registered .

men try to rest 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police information , the men spoke the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old denied the request and continued with her friends .
then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to grab the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s N@@ ec@@ kl@@ ace , which , however , failed .

the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make up its long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow site for managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has weighed about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory producing hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s subsidiary , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that financing for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses strongly on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and wealth , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value our ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies active in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , continually review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we fully appreciate the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La League website may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
in her pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave after she has left an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional athlete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator was deliberately dis@@ car@@ ded in the Royal Fiel@@ ds street in front of the property number 30 sco@@ ot@@ ers and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damage done by more than 200 euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , requests for information .
for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses .
because a car met him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the lead .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 7.@@ 55 o &apos;clock in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the vicinity of the neighbourhood of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to leave to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead .
on passenger cars , property damage originated .
the driver of the forthcoming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damage , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the caus@@ al experience to contact the police station in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication against the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , who was expecting an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Ludwig Müller , and today &apos;s Cardinal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; double standards . &quot;
no one doubt about the ass@@ aults in Regensburg that these are &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ pi@@ ani@@ as , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ qu@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a wonderful Fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strokes have been a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on abuse , Pope John George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment commissioned by Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen stations were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of assault , 67 dom@@ sp@@ lic@@ ts sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that is why in many cases even positive memories are linked to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence in protection at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ok@@ er and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems to be in it at all .
he is currently dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of ac@@ compli@@ ce or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the clas@@ h of non @-@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool was also ex@@ propri@@ ated beyond its sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have not taken the first hints taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
in this way , the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to wound out@@ breaks .
he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and cast the key on the ground , but also distributed ear files and too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you also know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state college .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the forci@@ ble eating at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one can ask oneself if it is not more familiar with his acquain@@ tance and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot has been reported on the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger published in the final report any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a conductor , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
what is the evaluation of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Stu@@ dents in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that it was just about him ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive resp@@ . more clearly or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment concerned himself in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to link up his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forci@@ ble exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .
it is clearly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we once say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral @-@ sc@@ rap@@ pers .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were tos@@ sed and portrayed , and suffered from them , were all ex@@ propri@@ ated at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ litter gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently keep his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral hospital gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment would continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative publicity , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pun@@ ishments were also forbidden in Bavaria for a long time .
before that , they were in a legal grey area , as everyone knows of us .
it was difficult to estimate for him where the affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ sed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one cannot say that he always had looked away .
that &apos;s just not right .
only in 1980 the testing penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of assessing the past of today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was h@@ ein@@ ous at all times , and also not for what was thrown down at school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then usual .
that &apos;s all terri@@ bly and I am happy that it will finally work .
but at the same time I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all of this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus creating ear @-@ sla@@ gs and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden then he strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of its Regen@@ s@@ burger period has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the issue of Prü@@ gel@@ sentence go to language as well ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , because the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , one does not only make a big singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond that , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , gra@@ cious , deeply faith and sav@@ our@@ y man , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could also do something about a fly .
I get regularly with how many former dom@@ es still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his accreditation , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen stations are thank@@ ful to him today for enri@@ ching their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certain that may be - but it was also a lov@@ able respect for which to look at them today and to honor them .
and please , once again clearly : all you acc@@ use him are educational methods , which at that time were on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the An@@ c@@ est@@ or would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who earned great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
