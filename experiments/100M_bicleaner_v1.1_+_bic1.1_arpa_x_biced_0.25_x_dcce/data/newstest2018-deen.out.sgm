<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Institute, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich fosters exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, who had to upset himself, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called "primers" sheets, were incorporated into the large general map for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian Verveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern Card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographische Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian versioning administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is most impressive at the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today it is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Comfortlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in appears a small-scale card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbers from the so-called "primitive" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots occupy no more farmers than farmers, but small gardeners of the plant "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of the subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the location of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street names" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or" "" "Auf der Lüften" "", "but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 there was the Munich circle-asylum-institution "Auf der Auer Lüften" (Lüften mit der Auer Lüften).</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and, for example, finished the chains of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Cyclique penitentiary in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "house was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the asylum, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as" "" "main place" "", "the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, Small Business Houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were preceded by the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn road.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fills the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Advancement of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, fast-based incidents happen in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to attract discrimination, as well as the State's law enforcement authorities who are disproportionate on minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready if they bring coworking money or let relatives know they are going through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation program of the FBI, which classify the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States have adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the further reprofiling of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischbacher" "" "project is a success project and will continue in the coming year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac created an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right graveyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he generates 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments Feriengaste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "fundamental important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate profitably on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot of things must be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not perform biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader fostering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the reforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue to operate," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticized because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 pitches of eleven participants were fenced with electric fence support.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-maintenance area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half about leader was promoted, a quarter carried the village of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers therefore left 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landladies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also noted:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows for state support of forfences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a subsidy recorded by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the enclosed area must not be smuggled (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fishermen's electric fence project, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-plan area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have repudiated him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he picked up its meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta wrote, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factual right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the howling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, longing to breathe freely, the elining waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when" "" "falling waste" "" "was better visible on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very well that they had taken a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big cry rush Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not a drawer, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, poor, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to enlighten the way, but to ignite hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is remembered for a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the athletics of the UK, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship cadres "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as team captain.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and with the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a big honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the people of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until newspapers struck him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He was knocking at the criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we are led like sheep to sleep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter response with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his electors and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments would be nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post."</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times if you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="232">Over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="248">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="249">It rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">In her wooden house in Envirali, the capital of the Paniai Regentship in the erratic indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="251">After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="252">Degei sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>

<seg id="257">"no one dares to run around after 5pm in the village," she says.</seg>
<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was commenced in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement, which was stirring up for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>
<seg id="260">In 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea's eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="261">The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour journey by car.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="263">The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated sheet roofs that were converted by rust into different yellow-brown tones.</seg>

<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport reduced the value of $3.1 billion in gold and copper.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has a valued 78 billion US dollars worth of wood resources.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a stifling presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuvian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas tribal land in the 1970-s were made to commit genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="279">Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators in the region alone.</seg>
<seg id="280">"we Are Making Everything" is in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as unlawful killings and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="282">The screws have increased because Papuas resources make a influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>

<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre in order to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="301">They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in the circle running and a bird song imitiating - from Papuas Mee Pago tribe.</seg>

<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents who admitted they had knowingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent millennials were compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were purposefully passed to TSA agents were food and fluids.</seg>

<seg id="413">The company said it consulted travelers across the country to find out how many inadvertently made smuggling goods through airport security and how many had deliberately done it.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-changing figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk for the first time betrayed another less brilliant figure when announcing the latest quarterly results: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation Tesla pays €1000 (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment."</seg>

<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be combined - 500,000, a million in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who order a "Model 3" today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines that have never been tested in practice without greater interruption with maximum occupancy.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if it comes to major delays, then the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a Serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius press is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors Tumlingens their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle (St. Hilariuskapelle) was first mentioned in written reference in the Württembergischer Chamber of Württemberg: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen with the Vogatory "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patron was right and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the lower village and the upper village, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the community centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps dating back to the 1600's date back these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected to this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The two of them melt together at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the second world war in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's night in 1834, a storm broke out the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower remaining today remained as a witness to the 750 year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at that time in Viersen, only at the border to Schwalmtal there was a wind force concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-year households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer there was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg region.</seg>

<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven up the city centre - to landlords, the companies of the whole city and clubs.</seg>

<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a statement by NATO, it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive force."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured were in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Airfield Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>

<seg id="758">The establishment of a community space would be, as reported by Tjaden, by 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed solution foresees to signal the investor that in this regard there is no billboard between the legs, the statement that both semi-trailers are leaning against the environment, as well as the roof of the roof, which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer doesn't just mean this additive.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a concrete section of seven tons was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three reconstructed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges run across the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fixing that is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of tact has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handing over the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building farm building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach place entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The costs for the three bridgeships will amount to 700 000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties draw on a strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the county of volcanic Eifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which shows a peaceful flag this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites to a poster of "great election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="934">And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="935">But those who have been on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD artists, but to demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally the city picnic under the slogan "All at a table" was planned on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking place underneath the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>

<seg id="947">This is also done: at about 8pm, a band for entertainment at the Rondellplatz provides various orators in the Stadthalle, among them the Rhine-country-pfälzener AfD-chairwoman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Prime Minister Beatrix of Stork to speak.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD-event lasts, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How football rules affecting Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed spending of European football associations will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequence will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the executive organisation supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG needs to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose in order to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's financing through the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract legitimate income sources that enable them to break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrawn their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "during the current three-year FFP delay period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, its UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, will continue to impose excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid out the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, hit the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catarist company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar's World Cup is going to be ambassadors and that such manoeuvres for the UEFA regulation authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to comply with any attempt to bypass the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of over €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last owner of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy malign plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-sung impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sub-lip font of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental delusions that could incite this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon also reminds us of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its east-west-west wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director gives to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 80s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard boiled Gregor and an idealistic isosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues from Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English are synced.</seg>

<seg id="1265">The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members stripped in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>

<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resided in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"" "" "" "before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," "" "says Joanne." ""</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling wasn't large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled the fan to place two spaces in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classical copper-light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make him look for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in there," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is objectionable, so when you push the door, it is very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "Erfan says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide to not leave this.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a debate about one of Victorias's largest real estate empire valued at over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets should be divided.</seg>

<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There she founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin has property valued at $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought about the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul says, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some property incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicatessen in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Liegenschaft in which Colin opened the first denim shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old). "</seg>

<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are, Paul says" "" "over the conditions of their financial separation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very well, even though he was a former AFL board member and, following a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>

<seg id="1388">New chief of staff plans to restrict the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff at his first working day, he presented a major problem in president Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry about fair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing," "" "said the former election officer Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping the Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials, insists that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have contained even more ignition material without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers manage to keep anger from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politicians - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officers say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, gave the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson is permanently banished from Twitter for chicans, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document Papierkram."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnights were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a gathering place, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the deployment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt, Mayor Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke to the house of serious interested parties back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US president Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller was said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel has recorded the work over the past few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, referring to people familiar with the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that there are already the first subpoenas of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have accused the Kremlin of intervening specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the Trumps franchise campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more Trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "a few weeks ago, the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote that the special agent Trump came to the centre in person and forbids the accusation if the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to review this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide if an indictment is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury are therefore also referred to as Indictals.</seg>
<seg id="1491">In most cases, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to invite people to take a hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, it was reported in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Beside Trump Jr. also Trumps counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his acting campaign manager Paul Manafort, were talking about the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts told on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mueller doesn't let himself intimidate in his work and that if necessary, he should act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the suspension of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">You have no reason to accept that something has changed in it, it was mentioned in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only deployed after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have become loudly, he has hindered the judiciary.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The collosed colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Horseshoe floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and abrupt was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shelf will fall there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stand under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not raise sea level, as it floats on the water and squeezes ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers straight into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the records began," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is the question whether the Larsen-C-Schelhagus will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly gather together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not decline the breakage of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen apart during the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The drop in temperature had contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees over the past 50 years, thus counting on the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">It was only shortly before the summer break that 41 new jobs were instated in the administration.</seg>

<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be found for the places to be held this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still missing staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 unoccupied spots in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for human resources and human resources development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract forward-looking candidate shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate both internally and externally, point out concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education campaign, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus, it is high time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Turnbull, the leader of the CDU, goes further with his party on the common motion.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been worried about a bad surprise when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money only if you change to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certain to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobo has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for automakers to install machinery to neutralize the exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful automobile companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cizade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589, there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahuth.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and even though the terrain is now more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug royalty that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartoons in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have angered the sons, suspicious gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to not force Valdez to seize the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for North Korea in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the poison gas problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she won the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug dealers in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "anger is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a mid-size area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters inquired if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, whom the governor himself designated as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former famous Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the state expenditures that concentrated on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost ruled all the political levels almost the entire century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they themselves have never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez cut a few notes and went to the office of the prosecutor the next morning for another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become even stronger throughout the country by written down "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them, because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be reorganised by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and a valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a reciprocity, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to interfere with its surroundings better and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shade - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sunk on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermoplastic, carnivorous dinosaur standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying predecessors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavier monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he founded the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average around 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protruded from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater coverage of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>

<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, miles long jams - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the Autobahn Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, between 17h00 and 5pm, between the junction centres Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg), nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of publishers initially did not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was about light to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of emergency vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: you just sit in the train and sleep.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2004">With the test customers a button for electronic devaluation will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives at the ticket control in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train attendants simply check in in the DB Navigator.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the greatest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not all the documents that one needs to devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, resulting in poor athmosphere in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one's own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the woman in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people who cried, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>

<seg id="2039">After landing at 23.00 she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two had a talk that they had "over the black experience and the black state" countless times before this morning.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived at Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp site when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the minority student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community which profited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson have not centred their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that is coming together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life, as she falls in love with her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the incarnation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrara's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have taken the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>

<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While advocates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, from which the other shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will end with the start of the construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence service analyst served a 35-year sentence after publicly discredited diplomatic news on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and landmark dissertation, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created an algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary, not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through prison, their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits vaguely on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became an unequal brigade, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a cartoon" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili-Kanungo, who predicted a future in which the President would transform the judgement and she would be able to personally see the exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama really was just a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would require a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is launching a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to solve the rigid splits he should actually resolve.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement, written down on the wall of the Gallery, Manning demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousend of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how remarkably similar, at least in biological respect, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what hopefully people will take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-free phone in the hand of the disciplinary teams of the United States, such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-ups race is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographical groups, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow managers to circumvent managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next one who has been involved in scandals since a former colleague has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this desire is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent gives companies tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS-Hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive officer is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves inethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has deployed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company Convercent utilizes, problems previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>

<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and pollute the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Slipping secured $10 million in November by Bessemer venture partner and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that is listening to their votes, and that the work you do, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture are important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can result in disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have gone too much to collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the realm of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpups have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples down to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman progressively look." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpups have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they appeal to, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the True Companion website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" "" "in spirit" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when you go a step on Frigid (i.e.: reluctant) Farrah, worry a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men then have Roxxxy?" "" "says the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offending until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who boasts that women have been sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex-robots consists in creating a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump agreement of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all strain ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is linked to me in another context that it also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the distorting impact of his presidency has the strength to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that his kittens will not be repelled one day any more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even more horrific long-term scenario where Trump is republicising the right wing" "" "normalized" "", "which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today trapped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the mad - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both found in fact one of very mild offences in comparison to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimbling music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still out of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can walk on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I wearied the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to the first death belt for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, firing it several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he kept his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, saying they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "the National Law Enforcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found out at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cell is found in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet more tolerant of tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel lieus if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same family, who had been separated, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microcosm of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro-intestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment, so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri found themselves in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan's by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to be rehabilitated over the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development informed city development on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there has been some rehabilitation zones.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous restructuring is a "success project" - it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros were received from the country, the rest from the municipality of sensations.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "one will, so Schindler continue to investigate, where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">It also plays a role whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabilitating.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the regional boundaries could also be postponed again.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme" "" "Social City" "", "in which the restructuring would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalization of internal cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be made object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a set of rules.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year the survey would only be carried out, within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December it should take place as soon as possible, so that the renovations can be started next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">For this reason, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and plot bend" "", "in which it deals among other things about the constructional condition and the remediation views." ""</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as navy One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter made in Connecticut was on display next to a yacht of Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn according to the notes of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it is such an unusual event with great visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superiors, the deputy military commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7am for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours.</seg>

<seg id="2865">In her pursuit of Neymar, Paris Saint-Germain will not leave after she has left an offer of £189 million to release his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional athlete of the world. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president in front of this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum arrived at the B 215 from Stolzenau with his VW at 7.55 o'clock in the direction of Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the vicinity of the neighbourhood of Stolzenau, a passenger car came to meet him in his lane, so that he had to leave to the right.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," announced after publication against the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, who was expecting an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Ludwig Müller, and today's Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral-cats with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">No one doubt about the assaults in Regensburg that these are "shameful and shameful deeds," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," such as the author Lucetta Scarpianias, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarquia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and that's a wonderful Fressen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "strokes have been a very normal educational tool" "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on abuse, Pope John George Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment commissioned by Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen stations were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of assault, 67 domsplicts sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to many other defendants, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R." "", "and that is why in many cases even positive memories are linked to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence in protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choker and perfectionist who became palpable when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger seems to be in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is currently dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of accomplice or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The clash of non-violence at the preschool was also expropriated beyond its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, experience it too late or have not taken the first hints taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">In this way, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger described him as "warm," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always moved from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to wound outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">He was deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he did not only bang with chairs and cast the key on the ground, but also distributed ear files and too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state college.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the forcible eating at the preschool, this is certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One can ask oneself if it is not more familiar with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot has been reported on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger published in the final report any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a conductor, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the evaluation of Ratzinger's Domspatzen-Students in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that it was just about him... Buben intrusive resp. more clearly or even more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment concerned himself in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link up his good name to these conflicting crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, there was a lot of" "" "forcible excesses" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is clearly separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we once say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral-scrappers.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were tossed and portrayed, and suffered from them, were all expropriated at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domsplitter gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme of "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently keep his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral hospital gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the preschool, the punishment would continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative publicity, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing punishments were also forbidden in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they were in a legal grey area, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate for him where the affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he always had looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "pitfalls of anachronism," i.e. the danger of assessing the past of today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was heinous at all times, and also not for what was thrown down at school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terribly and I am happy that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus creating ear-slags and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden then he strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of its Regensburger period has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of Prügelsentence go to language as well?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, because the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Weltrang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, one does not only make a big singer from rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and beyond that, I experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply faith and savoury man, of whom one can't imagine that he could also do something about a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domes still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his accreditation, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen stations are thankful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certain that may be - but it was also a lovable respect for which to look at them today and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all you accuse him are educational methods, which at that time were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Ancestor would command a 93-year-old man who earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
